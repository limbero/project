Mentos
Mentos taste like shit though. The idea is is what overwise tasty food would suck over rice. 
Diet Coke
With rice pudding?
Gaki no tsukai? 
These always give me indigestion.
This is the most underrated comment.
Do you drink diet coke? 
He *is* diet coke.
Mint mentos: 8/10

Fruity mentos: 8/10

Mint mentos with rice: 6/10

Fruity mentos with rice: 7/10

Thank you for your suggestion.
fruity mentos and minty mentos with rice and pepsi in a pressurised container: 1,000,000/10
But this evidence is only anecdotal!
Screw fruit mentos go with some orange juice over rice
Fruity mentos are definitely 10/10
Fruity Mentos are God's dingleberries, 8/10? Are you wild? I have an addiction to those little drops of beauty.
That is a horrifying description
I lived off those for a few months in high school. It was expensive, but delicious. 
They make my teeth/jaw hurt but I refuse to stop eating them!
Airhead bites, man. They're little bits of fruity candy crack.
If you have an addiction I don't think you can be objective.
I can't accept the fruity mentos would rate the same as minty mentos. Fruity are clearly superior.
I'm debating weather or not you know what dingleberries are. 
Roflmao !!
*whether
Omg laughing so hard! Wasting so many minutes of my life reading this pointless thread.... 
I know.
Are all these ratings theoretical? Or are you trying each response yourself?
You just happened to have both kinds of mentos?
Guys, I'm not sure he even spaghettis.
Yes
I try a bit of all of the suggestions I am able to do.
I like the cut of your jib op. Last time I made too much rice I just ate fried rice for a week. 
Pics or it didn't happen
Still no proof? 
Now have you tagged as "Gross food tester"
/r/shittyfoodporn would love you, mate.
We want photo evidence OP 
Yes! This thread seems really fake without it. 

Horse shit: 0/10

Horse shit with rice: 0/10
Funniest comment yet !! Lmaoo
Or video evidence. You can easily get away with photoshop, but its not so simple with videoshop. 
He has a youtube channel about it.
Yeah, as they say "pics or didn't happen"
OP never delivers
op post an album to /r/shittyfoodporn 
Yes, how could he not take pics?

Samsung phones even have a camera mode for food pics.
I don't even care the comments alone are worth it.
You mean Instagram? 
Which one? I have the 4 and can't find it. But you did lead me to discover a bunch of ballin' options so thanks!
##S5 Directions

1.  Open the Camera app and tap on the Mode button.



2. Scroll through the list until you reach Food.

If you don't see Food then proceed to Step 3.

##Note 4 Directions 

1. Open the Camera.

3. Look for Food mode. 

4. If not found, hit the Manage Modes button.

5. Check the modes you wish to add to your menu and tap Done. You can also uncheck modes you don’t want to see. However, we recommend you check them all.

6. If you still don't see Food . Hit the Download button to import additional modes that aren’t already on the phone.



#Hopefully this will help because I don't know I have an iPhone 5.
...you magnificent bastard.
i remember when "samsung phones" used to include the note II.
I have no idea why I even read through this whole thing since I have an iPhone as well. Then when I realized I was had at the end, I felt even dumber because I thought that there might actually be a "food" mode on the camera. I am dumb as fuck.
Think that's bad? I actually looked for it on my note 3, felt shafted, read your comment, then felt really dumb lol
I am sorry my post made you feel dumb. 

Here is a picture I found on Google for you. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/bkAIUWQ.jpg)

It really is a nice lamp.
Talk about knowing your market.
Key question: how is the rice going to be prepared? Steamed? Fried? Any seasonings added to it?
Good old basic steamed rice. The only thing added will be the food that you give.
No salt?

Might be a bit late
I thought you season it with love as well :(
What kind of rice? White? Brown?
OP said jasmine rice

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2np694/what_tasty_food_would_be_distusting_if_eaten_over/cml8i30
are you using a rice cooker?
Indeed.
As I was reading more and more I became increasingly frustrated with the thought that you may have been doing this with those gross one minute microwavable excuses for rice.
Hell no. I made hella good jasmine rice with my cooker.
i didn't realize everybody was teleporting the food to you. 
he is going to the magic house that you can trade munny for food
Cereal 
While the page was loading I was thinking: Cereal would be pretty gross. I was not disappointed.
People eat rice with milk for breakfast, this will just be cereal with an interesting texture mixed in.
I once put some leftover cooked rice on warm milk with cinnamon, and cereal on top. It was really good.
I at rice with milk sprinkled with a few lucky charms for breakfast for months.

A spoonful of sugary American "cereal" and a bowl full of rice has just about the right amount of sweetness for a breakfast, mate.
Ooh! Rice krispies w/ rice milk and rice. Ricier than a slammed honda civic with neons and a coffee can exhaust.
Rice *is* a cereal!
Specifically Rice Krispies.
Snap! Crackle! Pop!

Rice Riceys!
Man, I've been worrying about my dad's broken rib and haven't really laughed for a few days. Thanks for the laugh, and take my upvote, man.

Fruity Pebbles + milk: 9/10

Fruity Pebbles + milk over rice: 8/10

It's like fruity rice milk!

Thank you for your suggestion.
my mom would always make rice with lots of milk and sugar and raisins its pretty good
> It's like fruity rice milk!

That's exactly what it is..
What I wanna know is how much weed is this kid smoking to eat all this fucking rice ??
Fruit Pebbles + milk + rice is like horchata for obese Mexicans.
The comments....
Isn't fruity pebbles rice anyway?
Pass, rice milk is not my favorite 
Have you ever made your own rice milk? It's really easy and you can flavor it however you want. I almost exclusively use homemade rice milk ever since I discovered how easy it is. 
But rice cream is pretty damn good.
You can never tell when it expires...
You should try Horchata and report back when you change your mind.
I am not a fan 
Isn't that what horchata is?
You're missing out. Add a little sugar and a little butter, maybe a little vanilla, warm up milk melt butter and stir. Delicious. 
On the reals tho, breakfast rice is hella tasty 
That might be good, I have only ever had it cold 
That's righht!
how do you feel about milk steak?
Milk steak and a side of cheese
Only if I have a side of jelly beans, raw
Have you tried it though ? I think it's delicious. You toast the rice slightly then blend it and it tastes like a popcorn milkshake.
How do you toast rice? HAHA in the toaster?!
In a pan. 
Popcorn milkshake?

Do you even *want* me to try it?
The what? I have to try this.
I love horchata (however it's spelled) but unfortunately I've never seen it at a grocery store. I suppose I could try making it maybe 
Idk if ranch market is all over the US but if you have one near by, they usually sell it.
I've replaced milk with horchata almost completely, except for things where I don't want it to be sweet. Works great in less sweetened breakfast cereals at least. I *sometimes* find it in grocery stores in the section with various boxed rice drinks. Tend to find it at Fred Meyer (Kroger owned?) more than Albertsons (supervalu?) stores. 
I confirm, it's popular here in Ecuador, is delicious.
Arroz con leche!
Popcorn Milkshake?!?!
Sounds so disgusting

Roast cooked rice or just rinsed rice?
I have not I guess it depends on how I would eat it, but your suggestion does sound good 
A Vietnamese girl made it for me, apparently it is popular over there.
I might actually try this 
The Vietnamese girl or.....
Por que no los dos  
Both...?
Vietnamese girl over rice. OP please.
Jelly beans.
Ghetto lucky charms.
JERRY BEANS~
This actually might work because, despite the apparent lack of sweet taste in rice, it is actually high in sugar and you can make a sweetener from it. 
Green Jello
you have to update your phone to kitkat or lollipop for the rice to fix it.
jelly beans are candy for people who hate candy 
Raw of course
Milk steak with a side of jelly bean pilaf
Jelly beans: 8/10

Jelly beans with rice: 4/10

Little too weird on the textures and not the best flavors either.
Try with pinch of uncooked rice. It adds crunch. 
It is a thing. Next time you go to a Chinese buffet, I'm almost positive there'll be jello somewhere in the cold section with the orange slices and chocolate pudding. 
Jello is nothing like jelly beans.
I guess I responded to the wrong comment somehow.
Thank the man for his jelly beans!
Dude how does it feel to have made over 125k Karma in under 24 hours?

Was it regular jelly beans or Bertie botts
I'm sure you mean Jelly Belly, but I'll pretend this never happened. 
Regular jelly beans.
How about those terrible Harry Potter Jelly Bellies, like dirt, grass, and vomit flavors?
That would be Bertie Botts, I think.
Found the white guy
Okay, 

A: you're extremely late.

B: I don't get the joke you're going for. Why does the fact that I've read Harry Potter make me white?
Hah you got downvoted for not knowing the specific name of a candy from a fictional book. Welcome to reddit.
The book is real.
> you got downvoted for not knowing the specific name of a candy from a fictional book

Well, I mean, it's sort of a gimme when the name is in the previous comment. Like, come on.
It's not a gimme if you've never read the book / seen the movies
How the fuck's he supposed to know the *concept* then?
I can't name five Harry Potter characters and I even know about Harry Potter nasty beans.
For those who haven't read the books or seen the movies, "nasty beans" is not a euphemism.
Welcome to the YouTube comment section..no sorry, reddit
That's because you didn't pair it with your finest milk steak.
And a little cat food.
Fuck that, rum ham
Boiled over hard. Plus I bet his jellybeans weren't raw. 
Beer. Even when that beer is Coconut Curry Hefeweizen and it seems like it would taste good over rice. It definitely does not. 

...not that I would know or anything. 
Riunite on ice - NOT RICE!!!
Do you drink Busch products? If so, you have drunk rice and beer.

Source: http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/gutcheck/2014/06/anheuser_busch_lists_ingredients_in_budweiser_and_bud_light_for_the_first_time.php
Wouldnt really consider a beer a food though
It doesnt. 
It is recommended to put a few grains of rice in the bottom of your glass when drinking Edelweiss. It controls the bubbles.
Coconut curry Hefeweizen?? Please direct me to this. 
http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/detail.aspx?id=f2f3e12a-2544-49a9-a73f-ad2ee261aebe
It's actually better as it warms up because then the coconut curry flavor really comes out. And it tasted so much like coconut curry that drunk me thought that it would be delicious over rice. So I made rice and tried it. Drunk me was very very wrong. 
Coconut curry hefeweizen? I can't decide if that is the worst thing ever or the best. 
It was the worst thing ever when it was cold. It turned into one of the best as it warmed up. Almost like it needed to be warm to taste more like curry? My mouth was very confused. 

...which was what led to the beer on rice experiment. Because drunk logic is just like logic, but with less logic. 
Rice beer is fairly common. Also cooking rice with beer instead of water, sounds delicious.
coconut curry hefeweizen?? what godless part of the world do you live in?
Idaho! It's pretty god-full though...
Coconut Curry Hefeweizen... What in the seven hells?
So I saw this and thought I'd sub in for our awesome friend here, since I just happened to haven some leftover rice for dinner.

Blue Moon beer - 9/10

Blue Moon over rice - 6/10

Taste isn't even that bad, but I made a serious miscalculation over the fact that the rice would warm up the beer.
Should've chilled the rice. 
You gave blue moon a 9/10? It's a 6... maybe 7/10 at best
14, can't do anything alcoholic sadly.
Simple solution: beer fried rice. Cook out the alcohol and have fun watching the flames dance on the skillet. 
Wow you're only 14?  Your proper punctuation and capitalization had me fooled.  Props to you!
Check my post history, I'm pretty much his age (I'd rather not say my exact age). 

Although I'm sure if some of the people from my old school has reddit and we checked theirs it'd be a much different story... (it was one of those sports > education schools, understandably I left) 

OP is also surprisingly funny for people our age, though; typically our humour revolves around inside jokes, dumb jokes and 'satirical'/ironic things (and, here in Australia, politics, although we probably don't need to because our government is already a joke) 
I'm 15 and want to die when I get text messages saying "wut r u doin 2day?? lol" or something similar. God damn, is spelling and grammar really that difficult? I remember reading about how that kind of shorthand was created to save time when people had to touch buttons multiple times to get the right letters. Well, guess what, people: Phones have keyboards now.

</rant>
Hey, as a 14 year old I camoflague with my friends by replying like that, otherwise they will think something's wrong. 

I have said "ayy lmao" more times than I thought humanly possible.
ayy lmao

> I remember reading about how that kind of shorthand was created to save time when people had to touch buttons multiple times to get the right letters. 

Jesus Christ now I feel old. 
You guys remind me of me as a ~15 year old. I like you guys.
No wonder why you guys got bullied. I would know, since I was like you too.
[Story checks out...](
http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dpyul/who_would_like_to_get_their_photo_drawn_by_an_8/ )
But that means...
OP had a child at age 5. The only reasonable explanation here
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Why did I click that? WHYYYYYYYYY?!!!???!
Or maybe he has another son that is 14, and the son used his account to make this thread.  I'm no detective though
He also said he was a 17 year old Californian girl in another thread, so
Sounds like a 14 year old.
OP is forcing his 14 year old son to eat rice with weird things?
I now have you tagged as, "Younger and funnier than me"
Well you're not missing out. Not on beer over rice, at least. 
Kids younger then most of us and raking the karma in 
At least not legally.

RIP mobile users.
How old is the average Redditor, anyway?
I think the median age was 25 last time they did demographics. 
Most are old enough for a neckbeard. 
So 14 and ↑ and male
Good sir I must protest. At 14, one simply *cannot* grow a beard as full and manly as mine. 
Maybe I was a bit too euphoric at age 14 then
My good sir, my neckbeard is much more suited to be considered a true neckbeard than whatever scruff you had at the age of 14. I will have you know that the only appropriate cover for my face; a greasy pepperoni pizza looking affair. In fact, I challenge you to a memeing and karma duel, in which I shall undoubtedly victorious.
1v1 me on wow to settle this 
Basically once you get awkward and weird enough that you can't talk to your friends about it. Bam your a redditor. we will find and recruit you some how some way maybe with cats or butplugs.
While not helpful I think the range was 17-24
Explains a lot..
Hey, I'm 17-24!
Oh god.  Ive reached the upper end of the average. I'm too old for this shit.
Shitt, I'm pretty close to aging out of average
I'd bump that from 18-31. Or at least 26.
I'm 19, and I see a huge variety of people on here.
Well that was the range that the majority of users fall under if I recall correctly

You're by far the funniest fourteen year old I've ever encountered.

Edit: the details on OP's age are sketchy

This is the most witty 14 year old I've ever seen. He should have his own talk show.
You obviously didn't know me.

OP's youtube video. can confirm, no child.
What are you talking about? That does look like a 14 year old. 
Far more likely he's lying about being older than younger. He didn't advertise his age in this thread; it just came up.
So where is it op is lying hmm
Ahh, dousing my torch in petroleum already.
That's...odd
Op needs to get his lies straight.
14 year old with an 8 year old kid. 8/14 with or without rice
The hilarious thing is that no one even cares if he's lying, the rice has spoken. 
If meaningless stories entertain me, i don't care if they're true or not.
Does that mean I'm not an accident anymore?
Wow that's dark...
No. But it's a good origin story. 
I, as a 14 year old, feel like a failure after discovering you're 14.

But, I also like rice. Rice is good.
It's not that funny bruh
Out of everything in this thread this made me laugh the most.

No fucking ice cream over rice...
Rice cream
That's gotta be cold for your wang and unpleasant for the rice.
My favorite way to eat ice cream is served with sticky rice and almonds, it's a Vietnamese thing called Kem Xoi. 
Actually its pretty good. There is an indian dessert that has rice and something like an melted ice cream. Its served cold not frozen.
But over sticky rice it's delish.
Next level tapioca????
Japan would like a word with you about Mochi.
Have you never had mochi?
Try it at a thai restaurant with sticky rice. It's like a parfait and may be life changing (although probably not).
 did you mean rice cream? 
I regularly have icecream with jasmine white rice, sugar and milk. is nice.
Ice cream on top of sweet sticky rice? :)
I guess you've never tasted  rice pudding in ice cream or popsicle form. Fucking WIN 
ice cream is what came to my mind.  I think the worst thing would be the texture of the rice in a bite of smooth ice cream. yuck. 
Ice cream with rice in it is so good though

Mango ice cream over sticky rice is fucking delicious.
Mango sticky rice with vanilla ice cream is a tasty variation on the traditional thai mango sticky rice. Sticky rice is cheating though.
RICECREAM!!!
mochi, a japanese desert, is pounded rice with ice cream in the center.  its very good...
That is not something you can objectively say because I think mochi is absolutely disgusting.  The consistency is nauseating and it doesn't taste very good.  In fact I'm not sure I know anyone that does like it.
You need to meet more people.
I'm not even sure how to reply to this.... Is this a serious suggestion? Like you think that I need more people in my life because I haven't talked to most of the people in it about mochi and the few I have talked to didn't enjoy it?  Or was it an attempt to insult me because I don't enjoy a food you do? Implying I'm asocial because I don't like mochi?  I'm just kind of confused why you thought this was an appropriate reply?
Mochi is pounded rice cakes. Only the American version has ice cream in the center.
Or red bean paste... Mmmmmm...
Or red bean paste... Mmmmmm...
mochi's just the pounded rice paste, actually.  Mochi ice cream is just one of the things it's used for, some other things including daifuku(mochi filled with generally a sweet bean paste) and soups.
Smores ice cream: 10/10

Smores ice cream over rice: 5/10

Sort of a weird taste when put together, not too pleasant.
But sticky rice is amazing... Maybe you should try heating the rice and adding custard and cinnamon.
*rice cream
I've had ice cream over rice, it was chocolate ice cream and chinese steamed rice. Waitress looked at 8 year old me like I was crazy but is was pretty good. 

Chocolate ice cream: 10/10

Chocolate ice cream over rice: 8/10
You should try coconut sticky rice ice cream, you'd love it!
I actually have! It's pretty good, probably will find a place to get it soon!
Nice! Good luck finding a place!
I lol'd: 10/10.
Are you claiming to actually be eating these combinations? I don't see how that's possible since most of your comments are only a minute or two apart.
I'm making and eating all of these over a time span, and then posting about them at the same time.
proof pls
poop over rice
How does that work when you're replying to the suggestions just an hour or so (or less) from the time the original suggestion was posted?

I want to believe, but I don't think I can.

Doesn't make this thread any less entertaining though.
TAKE PICTURES MAN
Pics or it didn't happen. 
Damn. You have a lot of rice. 
C'mon bro, it's just so easy to say you ate it and give a rating based on what you THINK. I'm not hatin' just lookin' for pics. Suh.
Suh?
It's like a more gentlemanly "bro". I like it.
"Yes suh, thank ya suh!"
accept its a black slavery term of sir
It's Korean suh! 
Damn.

Or does it just sound southern?
[deleted]
I'm from the south, and it really depends on where you are. What you're talking about sounds more like a Texas "sir", while what I'm talking about sounds more like a deep south "sir". Think Foghorn Leghorn. They have non-rhotic r's like Brits and Bostonians.

Hey fuck you
Did you just reply to my 5 month old comment
Yeah whatever man
Boil pot of rice. Add ingredients as suggested.
Leave this case alone, agent Mulder!
That makes sense. That's what i would do 
Well, he did add the "smores" bit, so one can assume that smores ice cream is the only flavor he had on hand.
Carrot cake isn't exactly the first cake i think off either
The truth is out there
Dude, the last episode is so good.
pumpkin pie

Oh... ha... ha... yeah... that was funny.... ha... ha... ha...
Nope, that would be delicious. Use short grain steamed rice and mash it all together. 
[Pumpkin Pie Rice Pudding](https://www.minuterice.com/en-us/recipes/13674/PumpkinPieRicePudding.aspx)
Slice of pumpkin pie: 9/10

Slice of pumpkin pie with rice: 7/10

Like peanut butter, this really masks the rice and doesn't change it too much.
Cause OP just had pumpkin pie laying around
Thanksgiving and shit.
What the fuck you didnt fucking give pumpkin pie 10/10 you punk!!!
How many bites are you eating of the suggested foods with rice? I need to know in order to fully gauge how serious you are actually taking these suggestions before deciding how to rate them... I'm not feeling your hatred towards pickles.... 
Did you seriously try all of these?
Yes I did!
I just watched the Youtube. You are delightfully insane.
link?
Thanks withheld 
Jesus Christ, OP. Your mom's going to come home and see that you ate a little bit of everything in the kitchen and that you ate *all* the rice.
9/10 my ass !
Your ass: 4/10

Your ass with rice: 9/10

The rice masks the flavor of your ass, and gives it a better texture. Thanks for the suggestion and your ass.
wat.  Rice is 10/10 but pumpkin pie is only 9?!  I call BS.
Because people with different food palettes are wrong!
Almost as if they where joking
Damn right.
OP is Asian. Only explanation. 
Can confirm. Am Asian. Rice 10/10 Pumpkin pie 6/10.
Spaghetti
You're wrong.
it's actually [a thing](http://62.90.138.233/blogim/smadari2008/images/2728453_196.jpg).

you fry the noodles a bit, so it's not bland. pretty good, but you'd wanna add more things to it.
That reminds me of one of my former coworker microwave lunches: A can of Chef Boyardee Spaghetti and Meatballs over white rice. I don't think I am ever going to try that.


I have a friend that eats spaghetti sauce over rice. She said it's amazing, but I'm not falling for it.
Rice-a-roni is an actual pasta + rice product. It's delicious, so I would imagine spaghetti/rice wouldn't be much different.
Noodle + Rice is delicious whatcha talking about?
So you've never been to Jolibee
Dip the chicken in the spaghetti. Yes.
latino family here.

We do this all the time. It tastes just fine and makes the meal more diverse. Would recommend.
You've never been to the Philippines.  
And some banana ketchup 
FFFFUCK THAT SHIT. I just wanted normal ketchup for my normal fries. A minute later I was scraping the shit off my tongue.
Don't need to go to the store for this one!

Leftover spaghetti from 2 nights ago.

Spaghetti= 10/10

Spaghetti over rice = 9/10, tastes good but is sort of a weird blend together.

Thank you for your suggestion.
now that's a proper Cameroonian meal
No, no, what you do is you put the spaghetti sauce on rice. It's *brilliant* trust me.
Will agree spaghetti is 11/10
DO U EVN SPAGHETTI?
Can verify, my grandma would eat this every spaghetti night when I was growing up.

Edit: clarity
Moms spaghetti 
My mom is Chinese so we did this once when she first made spaghetti. 
Spaghetti sauce with rice us pretty good. Rather have that than actual spaghetti noodles. I am also Asian...if that explains anything
Cause the key is to just use the sauce over rice, with no noodles.  Though this may become addicting, I warn you.
Who..   who made the spaghetti
Spaghetti on my rice already, mom's spaghetti.
One of our favorite dishes to have as children was spaghetti and rice in a light creamy spinach sauce (lots and lots of spinach, drown all the things in spinach!) I love the texture differences and the taste; you should try it that way.
i call it RASTA  Rice/pASTA...  been making it for years.  spaghetti aint the best way to mix it though.  farfalle or penne or even rigatoni works so much better.
Try Pilaf.

Start with a decent amount of spaghetti (or preferably vermacelli) cracked into small pieces, 1/4 cup of butter, pepper, thyme, and 2 1/4 cups (boiling) chicken broth (buillon is fine) and about a cup of rice.

Put a quarter cup of butter into a bowl and let simmer until it isn't foamy anymore, then add the pasta. Once the pasta is a nice red-brown color and smells delicious, add the rice and stir thoroughly. Then add the (already boiling) chicken broth. Heat until boiling again, then turn to simmer. Leave for 20 minutes. DO NOT STIR THE RICE DURING THIS TIME (or it will not be fluffy anymore :( )After 20 minutes, take off heat. Let sit for another 5. (again, do not touch. If you do, the whole world will be sad). After 5-10 minutes, enjoy. 

Best winter comfort food ever. 
***BROTHER!***
What?! I love rice with spaghetti. Or maybe its just cause I'm hispanic.
thought i was alone for a minute
I sometimes eat instant noodle or noodle in general with rice. Most vegetables go well with rice, as well as meat, fish, and potato. And yes I'm an asian.
Why have I never thought of this...
Dude Ramen with egg over rice is doooooope. And a lot more filling.

Oh my god I am laughing out loud so hard at this that my 4yo just asked me if I was ok. I am laughing like Muttley. So I read the thread up to your comment and he made me read it FIVE fucking times....so we are both cracking up but I don't even think he gets it.....

"How the fuck did a question about RICE become #3 of ALL TIME on Reddit?


"How long will this hold the title as #3?"

I'm here from the **FUTURE** to answer the later question.

This bizzare thread will remain #3 for the rest of this decade.  
On **4/20/2020** it is finally overtaken by a post in r/IamA:


IamA Trillionaire. After reading a post *from the future* on Reddit's infamous "with Rice" thread - I invested in companies researching the revolutionary material Graphene. AMA.  
submitted 2 days ago * by Gates_Is_My_Bitch
I'm really stoned and I can't deal with this. 
God dammit, its this kid again.
GREAT! skittles, oranges, mentos, AND MORE RICE.
Who the hell is getting home, cooking and eating rice and then getting back to the store in 15 minutes? 

Why wouldn't he buy and cook more rice at once? Buy more toppings at once? Doesn't he already have some stuff around the house that could be tried? This is extremely inefficient experimentation!
I work in a grocery store and we absolutely do not care about what customers are buying. 
This seems an unlikely scenario. How is he cooking an entire recipe plus round trip to the grocery store in 15 minutes? Why hasn't he purchased a larger bag of rice in preparation of his experiment? 
I bet OP just misjudged the amount of rice to put in the rice cooker and didn't know what to do.
He just says he has a pregnant wife at home which confuses them even more
Considering he's 14 he's probably just annihilating his parents kitchen right now. 
He probably waited until all the top comments came in and then bought and ate it all at once.  
Edit: nevermind, apparently op's just fucking nuts.
Yeah the grocery store is right next door to him. He answered a few times the last time he did this thread.
Where do you get all this money?
Uhhh, the Internet? 
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.

That's why so much is marketed to teens. Literally all of their income is disposable because they have no bills yet. My grandfather looked me in the eye when I was that age and said "you'll never be richer than you are right now". Had no idea what the hell he was talking about until rent, car insurance, kids... Good for this kid using his cash for science, especially hilarious edible science.
He pays for it with all that sweet, juicy comment karma from this thread.
My dad owns the other store down the street, you know the one with the ropes and weird clothes and those long rubber things my mom has a lot of in her third drawer.
Oh yeah, the ones with the funny taste.

Ice.

Rice is amazing with almost anything else.
Jesus Christ we've come full circle...
But... but I was told that rice is nice with ice!
:(

Childhood ruined
No rice is shit
Ice is a tasty food?
TIL Ice is a tasty food for at least 1240 redditors. 
Everyone is thinking of the wrong kind of ice
Rice with ice/cold water is actually pretty great.
Rice n' ice
So are you supposed to cook the ice with rice and is that supposed to be nice? 
Nice? It's paradise.
Rice Rice Baby
Hold on everyone, this might be a great idea. Boiled sweet rice + ice smoothy.  Maybe add some milk. It's like rice icecream. Ricecream!
Apparently it's a thing in Asian countries to throw a bit of water and ice into a bowl of rice to make it into a cooler summer time snack. I'm not into it but it's a thing.
Bitch you never had rIce? that's my shit.

rIce. look it up.
This is weird now that I remember it, but I used to eat leftover rice with cold water, ice, and my grandmas homemade beef jerky. And it was *delicious*.
ice/rice = 1/r
Is this the 5:00 Free Crack Giveaway?
So this one had to be cooked for various reasons. I boiled the rice and the ice, and I was left with rice.

10/10
You'd better be off to the copyright office dude, maybe even patent it.

rICE - for people that demand the peace of mind in knowing their rice had been cold at some point.
I.. I don't know what to say.
Interesting. You should think of a witty name for this dish. Something that combines the names of the two main ingredients...
Rice N' Ice, or for short, Ricenice.
Waiiiit....did this just become the most upvoted comment on this site?
RIP descartes before the hoes 
I think it might be. Beats the Kevin post by 5k.

This is making me lol a ridiculous amount. 
Holy shit this has to be the highest upvoted comment I've seen

I took science class once I got a 12% but atleast I did better than Billy. 
Rice is just ice with an r.
Woah
Ice - 7/10

R - 18/26

RIce - wat
Can you help me? I cant understand what this means.
Ice is 7 out of 10.

R is the 18th letter of 26 letters in the English alphabet.

Ice and R is RIce but the scales are different and also nonsense, so the answer is "wat." (What?)
Ice - 7/10 = 91/130    
R - 18/26 = 90/130    
RIce - 181/130

Orange juice.
I suggested this first. No matter...
Actually I like cooking my rice in orange juice. Seriously, it tastes good.
Sometimes people use orange juice with stock in Risottos.
Bananas don't float. 
With toothpaste
Actually if you mix a little orange juice in the water you cook your rice in it tastes really fantastic
I, personally, love orange juice over rice.
WITH toothpaste icing!
Easy there satan
http://www.cooks.com/recipe/x43rg37p/creole-orange-rice.html

...and yet, orange chicken over rice manages to be delicious.  Thank you, Chinese people, who are geniuses at making all sorts of otherwise nasty things taste good over rice.  I'd send you each a card, but there's, like, a lot of you.
I use orange juice with my stir fry sauce sometimes and serve that over rice.  Keeps it moist if it gets overcooked. 
Since when was juice a food?
Just add chicken..... Then, you have orange chicken over rice, delicious as fuck!
Actually I've put oranges in rice before, tasted quite good.  
Orange juice, ginger, red pepper and honey. Voila! General Tso's.

Orange juice: 10/10

Orange juice with rice: 3/10

I don't think most drinks are good with rice.
Try it with sticky rice, much better that way.
You haven't tried horchata, shikhae and other rice drinks yet 
Horchata! 
Try replacing some of the water with orange juice
Hochata?
Water is okay.
My mom used to cook wild rice with orange juice instead of water. It's fantastic!
Sake is pretty good with rice
Warm sake is good!
Tea. Tea. Goddamit. 
That actually sounds decent, if it's stronger tea.
It doesn't just sound decent, it *is* delicious.

[It's been a thing for centuries.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chazuke)
Mexicans use rice water+cinomin+sugar and some other stuff to make a tasty drink.
Arroz con Leche is pretty good too.  Don't think it would qualify as a drink though. 
No there's another drink, usually made in. Bucket cause it requires a lot of water
I know, horchata. But arroz con leche implies that it's just rice and milk and thought that would kind of fit. 
Horchata is like the liquid form of cinnamon toast crunch
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horchata
This!!!! It's soooooooooo good!
It is crazy good. Why isn't it fucking everywhere?
Come to Southern California. You can find this easily in any Mexican food, or taco places. 
You buy the tickets, I'll buy the horchatas!
I ... I don't know if that's worth it ...
Sure it is, I'm great company! Germany isn't so far...
Just ask in any Mexican restaurant. They've got it in back, it's just not always on the menu.
Idk I think it's common in the Mexican markets here in Texas I'll definitely check it out.
I've laughed harder at all your responses than ever before on any thread. Thanks OP. 
Jello
what if you put the rice in the Jello?
Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
I feel like there's some kind of "We can't joke about hiding things in Jello for a while" joke here, but I can't come up with a funny one.
ugh fuck. This sounds like a recipe from the 70's. 

   Source: Own several recipe books from the 70's; not exactly a culinary renaissance, that decade. Lots of rice, lots of jello molds.
What about ride pudding?
Jello: 10/10

Jello with rice: 8/10

This really should be a thing.
Its called rice pudding 
it is. Some hospitals serve jello with rice pudding. Also it's an old 50s recipe

Tapioca pudding.
It was in 50's. Gelatin in everything - tuna mayo Jello banana loaf, anyone?
http://www.cracked.com/quick-fixes/7-gross-foods-your-grandparents-ate-that-we-taste-tested/
The word of the day is 'aspic'.
Where's the larks tongue in aspic?
I'm not clever enough to subtly acknowledge how much I enjoy your King Crimson reference. :<
That's racist
No, no. *Aspic*. One word.
Really? That sounds awful. 
Tapioca pudding?
It is.  I don't believe OP.

Sometimes at the buffet I get rice in my jello (eat some fried rice with a fork, use said fork to pick up jello later), and it's terrible.

I mean, I still eat it, but it's about as bad as finding a rock in your cooked rice.
I'm totally surprised too
Distusting even.
You've never heard of rice pudding?  It's everywhere.  My grocery deli has it
I feel like this has sparked controvercy over pudding vs jello. 

There is only one man who could resolve this...
Rice Pudding is perfect and beautiful and wonderful and I will **LOVE IT FOREVER** 
I love YOU
I have a beard and can change my clock to 4:20

coincidence?

or destiny?
Pics or get the FUCK OUT.

By pics I mean gay nudes.

No.... no don't do this.  
And it bears no resemblance at all to rice and jello.
You're wrong.  Read the other replies
Are you maybe talking about jello as literally the Jell-O brand that also makes pudding? I thought we were talking about jello as in gelatin dessert, or what Europeans call jelly. There's none of that in rice pudding. It's just rice cooked with milk and sweetener. But Jell-O probably does make a "rice pudding" that's vanilla Jell-O pudding with rice in it so maybe that's why we disagree. 

I checked the other replies but couldn't find anything relevant, so maybe the real problem is that I can't read?
jello =/= pudding
No it doesn't.
But Jello/Jam and rice =rice pudding
What the hell type of rice pudding are you talking about? Any rice pudding i've had is like a sweet plain white pudding with rice.
I guess you've never had it then.  Rice pudding is practically rice jello.  What's in a name? 
[Tapioca pudding.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapioca_pudding)

They often put gelatinous balls made out of tapioca or whatever into those rice puddings.  It's not uncommon to have tapioca balls in something like [this.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A8#mediaviewer/File:Ch%C3%A8_%C4%91%E1%BA%ADu_tr%E1%BA%AFng_1.jpg)

It's fucking delicious.  But yeah, it's not straight up rice from the cooker...
Can't say I've ever had anything like that
Just because you've never tried it doesn't mean it's not something common as fuck lol
I don't think it's that uncommon in SE Asian cuisine (Vietnamese/Thai/SE China).

You usually stick with rice, though, because it gives enough gelatinous texture in these puddings.  But you can throw in tapioca balls or these type of [jellies](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzMxWDUwMA==/z/mQYAAOxywOtSXDEz/$T2eC16FHJIIFHJG5sli0BS(DEynQFQ~~60_12.JPG) into the dishes with more sweet bean than rice.

There's a chain in California and Houston, called Bambu, that have a ton of desserts (semi-drinks) with this kinda stuff.
Rice jello sounds like something appalling a Minnesotan would come up with.
Upvote for Minnesota! And we already have...

Edit: wow, had I read *one more line* I would've seen that you've been provided this info already. 
That would be rice, jello and  mayonnaise in a cake mold. Minnesota - n's  put mayo in everything. 
They totally [already have](http://www.cooks.com/rec/search/0,1-0,rice_jello,FF.html), eh?
That's just terrifying.  It's like the [1960s has come back to menace the 21st century](http://www.lileks.com/institute/gallery/knox/index.html).
Did you mean distrusting or disgusting? I need to know to answer the question properly. 
Are you saying Boo or Boo-urns?
The word I was looking for is dinosaur.

I always thought it was "picked up a monkey skull to go".  A number of lyrics websites agree with me.  Seems to change the tone of the piece a bit.

On the other hand, I also thought they called the TV show "Miami Bites" because I figured that was the kind of TV show dinosaurs would watch.  Nobody seems to agree with me on that one.
I'm still weirded out every time I remember that this song name-checks Miami Vice.

You are my god damn hero!
[This ain't no place for no hero.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1QUZzeZoPQ)

I can't see where you're comin' from

But I know just what you're runnin' from

And what matters ain't the who's baddest but the

Ones who stop you falling from your ladder,

When you feel like you're feeling now

And doin' things just to please your crowd

But I love you like the way I love you

And I suffer but I ain't gonna cut you 'cause

This ain't no place for no hero

This ain't no place for no better man

This ain't no place for no hero

To call "home"

This ain't no place for no hero

This ain't no place for no better man

This ain't no place for no hero

To call "home"

And every time I close my eyes

I think, I think 'bout you inside

And your mother givin' up on asking why

Why you lie and you cheat

and you try to make a fool out of she

I can't see where you're comin' from

But I know just what you're runnin' from

And what matters ain't the who's baddest but the

Ones who stop you falling from your ladder, cause

This ain't no place for no hero

This ain't no place for no better man

This ain't no place for no hero

To call "home"

This ain't no place for no hero

This ain't no place for no better man

This ain't no place for no hero

To call "home"

This ain't no place for no hero

This ain't no place for no better man

This ain't no place for no hero

I was kinda expecting that but hoped it wouldn't happen. I am now happy it did happen.

This was my favorite song when I was seven. It doesn't make any more sense to me knowing the actual lyrics than it did back then.
I'm sorry, I missed that - could you say it again please?

I lit a cigarette, picked up a monkey, start to go
The sun was spitting fire, the sky was blue as ice
I felt a little tired, so I watched 'Miami Vice'

I walked a dinosaur, I walked a dinosaur

One night I dreamed of New York
You and I roasting blue pork
In the Statue of Liberty's torch

Elvis landed in a rocket, rocket, rocket ship
Healed a couple of leapers and disappeared
But where was his beard

A shadow from the sky, much too big to be a bird
A screaming, crashing noise louder than I've ever heard
It looked like two big silver trees that somehow learned to soar
Suddenly a summer breeze and a mighty lion's roar

I killed a dinosaur, I killed a dinosaur

Mac and cheese with rice?
This is the only one I've already tried so far. Rice is decent filling, like the macaroni is in the "mac and cheese"
pretty tasty, actually.

like re-commend. I would commend you again for this mac n rice you made. recommended.
u wanna do sex OP? u seem cooll enough
Stop doing this.
Mac and cheese with rice topped with gravy all on mashed potatoes and mixed together is godly. 
Cheese and rice go well together.

Rice and salmon go well too.

Rice, cheese and salmon together do not. The rice is not the problem however.
I never liked cheesy rice...just didn't ever work. 
9/10 would recommend? 
I've eaten rice with cheese and tomato sauce and it's really good (try it!), but everyone might not like it. Also, how much rice have you got?
Only 9/10 for mac and cheese?!

Edit: never mind, I saw that 10/10 is reserved for Nutella in another comment. Order has been restored to the world.
Classic double carb. 
so much carbs
You are funny! This one had me rolling.
Easy on the molly m8y
How did you find this four months later?
God... OP I love you.
Might try try this then, thanks OP
It really is good!  I always have rice in the house as I buy it in bulk and it's cheap as fuck, and in college to stretch a box of mac and cheese, I'd cook them separately then mix 50/50 white rice and mac and cheese.
I love this thread so much!!
I love you so much.
you really are funny hahah, that made me laugh pretty good :D
I love you so much more

Cake.
The cake is a lice.
The cake is a lie...
So were all agreeing to the fact that rice cake is horrible
ok but this could work really well with sweet sticky rice.
There is an actual cake called Rice Cake...
I disagree: rice cakes are pretty good
OP will have to find a trumpet...
If rice pudding is good, is it possible that this could be decent if the cake was gooey enough?
I'll eat anything with plain rice, even cake
Ever heard of rice cakes? Heard they're pretty popular to over 1.5 billion people.  
Haven't u ever tasted rice cakes?
dont know why this is so highly upvoted, but theres plenty of sweet dishes with rice, and im sure one could make a great rice/cake thing.

You're about three months late! 
Skittles: 10/10 one of the best wonders of life.

Skittles with rice: 7/10

Weird combination but isn't too bad.
I call BS. I mean, come on people, it's frickin' skittles! It should taste good with anything!
Sour skittles? 
Happy cake day!

Browsing Askreddit/Top.
Would you try marshmellows? 
I though that might be the case. Plus seeing the colors bleed into the rice would be cool. 
What proportion of rice to skittles did you try ? And which flavors? All separately? Or did you have an orange skittle with rice? Because I think that's too close to the orange juice with rice you tried already.
Replacing lime skittles with green apple is where they lost me
its ight
Fucking agreed so disappointing
Lime lovers unite! I'm so over this green apple fad. It was getting into all the candies, but taking over Skittles was the last straw.

One time I bought some green gummy candy from my work cafe. I was hoping for lime, but figured mint would be almost as good. Sadly, it was green apple.
Mint wouldn't really go with other skittle flavors though...

Do you like burritos?
Only when there not from taco bell. going in is great then everything else after.... No
I never have bad poo poo after taco bell.
I wish my body was that awesome... I'll trade you?
Nah, I don't like taco bell that much anyways. Qdoba is where it's at.
I went there for my first time on valentines day. In order to get the deal 2 sloppy burritos for one I had to kiss my gay best friend. The guy let it slide but I was so willing to start making out for a free burrito... In a sense is that like..softcore porn? 
I could fap to that, so I guess yeah sure.
Technically... Anyone could lol
I have a burrito fetish.
Burritos look like dicks so I can second that.
Except that I'm straight. I rip off the top and it looks like a mushy vajayjay.
TIL burritos are transgendered. Any man can have there way with them.
hey bros can i join this threeway?  i prefer quesadillas but i can fry a mean burrito
You got it buddy, burritos bodies don't determine their gender.
Nutella.

Peanut butter and rice is also surprisingly ok.

why would you ever think this would not have gone together?

See this one isn't good because Nutella, like rice, is good with almost everything.
You can actually buy this in the store in the Netherlands, Duo Penotti with crunchy rice.
I will eat dog sh*t if it's covered in nutella. 
I imagine this would sort of be like nutella rice pudding...
Nutella: 10/10

Nutella with rice: 10/10

This is pretty damn good.

Be right back. I'm gonna go try this. 
Wouldn't it kinda be like a rice with a odd amount of peanut oil? Because I've had that and it wasn't god awful 
Thank you for your suggestion
Pretty sure nutella is good with everything.
I eat nutella and cous cous when out backpacking and its prolly my favorite meal. No joke. 
Actually adding a dollop of nutella to warm rice pudding is the fucking BOMB. 
Unless you don't like rice pudding.... Then you're just wasting perfectly good hazelnut chocolate spread !! 
This some Michelin star shit right hurr
Nutella is 10/10 but pickles are 1/10? Buddy I think you should switch these grades.
Can't be that good if you didn't thank him for the suggestion. 
Thank you for reminding me to thank him.
I'm on a diet you son of a bitch... 

I'm saving this for later though on cheat day. 
In the Philippines there is a sweet chocolate rice porridge called champorado. Fucking delicious. So I'm not surprised about the Nutella one 
Next week do Nutella!  What doesn't go good with Nutella. 
OP I think you've got a winner for your next round!
That's like 10,000 cal per spoon.
Homemade nutella rice pudding is divine. I make mine by placing a serving of rice per person in a pot, add two egg yolks plus enough milk to almost cover. If you're out of eggs you can skip them, it will still taste awesome just not be as thick. Bring to a boil stirring constantly over medium heat, lower temp and cook still stirring until thickens to coat the back of a spoon well. Should not take long after it boils, maybe 2-3 minutes tops. Remove from heat, beat in a tablespoon of nutella per serving. I like to place each serving in a wine glass or dessert cup and chill. Great topped with whipped cream.
Thank you wise cook
*goes to find Nutella and Rice*
Before you do this please bear in mind that Nutella is 50% sugar.
You're not getting any, I just took the last jar from Walmart.

Edit: I accidentally a word
I think you a word. 
You could mix shit with Nutella and it would be edible. 
Isn't that just like chocolate rice pudding?

Hot dogs and hamburgers (I have a theory that this is actually delicious but never tried it)
It is a basic thing in the Philippines to eat hotdogs or burger patty with rice.  
Wouldn't this be a poor college student version of fried rice?
Hamburger patty, fried egg over rice with gravy is a loco moco, which is incredibly good.
Mos Burger  is good.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Burger
Dude this is standard breakfast. Where on earth are you?
Rice + chili + cheddar + tortilla = delicious cheesy chili rice burrito. Seriously. Add some hot dogs to the chili if you want, or some ground meat to the chili, but get on that shit now because it is godly. 
Why not? Its just meat. Im sure it would be great.
dude, hotdogs + rice is retardodelicious
I chop up hot dogs (typically chipotle dogs) and add them to rice, it's especially good with peppers and onions.
Filipino Here, grew up on hot dogs and rice with eggs and ketchup and a dash of tabasco
you really didnt eat hot dogs and hamburgers with rice?

im alwwys eating them, without the buns
Rice and a hamburger plus some brown gravy and occasionally a fried egg is delicious and I think a Hawaiian thing called a [loco moco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loco_moco)
i eat rice with hot dogs all the time. its fucking glorious. the salt from the hot dogs goes pretty well with the rice. 
Hell yeah! Hotdog and rice pair well together. Hamburger is delicious too. I like mine with a little ketchup. And kimchi.
[Bro, do you even burger with rice?](http://i.imgur.com/QDdOGFf.jpg)

Seriously though, burgers with gravy is pretty much a common thing in the Philippines, and is fucking awesome btw. And also from what I've heard in Japan too as well.
Oh well I don't often have gravy on hand! 
The simplest gravy that was taught to me was, just chicken(or beef) stock, soy sauce, pepper, butter, mushrooms, and a bit of starch for thickening. You could add some hot sauce for a bit of kick. So yea, you can pretty much make them quite easily with everyday stuff.
It's funny the thread about rice has attracted so many Filipino redditors. 

BTW I would add a fried egg or two and devour that whole plate. Damn I'm hungry now.
Where there's rice, there's pinoys, 

I guess. I haven't tried burger steaks with fried eggs, but I guess I'll try it the next time I make some burgers.
Hot dog: 8/10

Hot dog with rice in the bun: 8/10

This is pretty good, would reccomend for anyone wanting to try something different.
Something I had a lot as a kid was mixing a bit of warm water with rice and eating it with hotdogs, ketchup, and sliced pickles. The flavors work well together.
chili and cut up hot dogs over rice is delicious. I call it poor mans food. 
I bet hot dogs would be good cut up in fried rice.
Sliced hot dog on rice is good too. 
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup minute rice
2 sliced hotdogs (or a fist full of lil' smokies if your feeling fancy)
3-5 slices of Kraft singles

Cheapest, tastiest, quickest meal ever.

When you can the chance, try it with hamburger.  Home made hamburger patties.  It's the best.
Edit: don't use the bun
how about rice bun burgers? 
I fucking new it, can you try hamburger now. Something tells me if you were to add a more Hawaiian type flavor to it then it would taste good 
My husband has comfort food of rice, chopped up hot dog, catsup and mustard, and hot sauce. He eats it all the time. If we don't have hot dogs, he uses beef. He says it's delicious!
Cat-soup? :(
Catsup = ketchup, my phone auto corrected that, ha, what an odd spelling...
That makes more sense. Silly phone trying to make you eat cats. 
those are staple brrakfast and packed lunch meals in thw philippines
I was thinking more chopped up hot dog in rice. Mmmmmm
I've done that a few times.  It's pretty tasty.
I had some leftover ham from thanksgiving and some mysteriously labeled "mexican rice" from Wal-Mart. I shredded the ham and mixed it with some veggies. Unbelievably delicious.
I'm glad the ham and veggies were good but how was the rice?
Delicious. Tasted kinda Cajuny. 
Are you Filipino? 
Nope. Half Puerto Rican.
Squad! Focus upvotes here!
I could imagine sticky rice wrapped around a hot dog and lightly fried until the rice is crispy would be quite tasty
They have in Taiwan when I was visiting. Rice pressed together to make the bun with stir fried beef and green onion instead of a patty. Unf. 
This comment makes me hate myself for being vegetarian. 
That sounds so good
Fuck my taste buds 
My hand went to my mouth in a reflexive action of awe. Must. Ingest. 
This is a thing in Taiwan night markets. A Portuguese style sausage inside a hotdog bun make out of sticky rice (the "bun" is rice inside a sausage casing, cut in half lengthwise). It's damn good 
I am going to make this and get back to you
I am saving this glorious comment. Holy shit.
The thought just made me moan aloud. 
In Korea we have sausage bits with rice cake in the middle at some food stands. (Rice cake = smushed sticky rice) 
Im totally making american sushi for a bbq next summer
American sushi! That's a great name for it, I want to try some too! :)
Lay down a hotdog over some seaweed wrap and rice, line of ketchup, line of mustard, wrap and slice. Boom. What else can we use? Burger, sausages, pulled pork, bbq chicken, chourice, linquica, avocado, coleslaw, bbq sauce, mayo, crushed lays for 'crunch' this is some pintrest shit

I could not come up with an american replacement for seaweed wrap
The crushed lays for 'crunch' is a very good idea, an awesome Americanized replacement for tempura! I was thinking pulled pork or some kind of shredded beef would make a cool filling too. Now if you want to go full-blown American, what if we take a delicious roll like the pulled pork sushi, drenched it in batter and deep fried it! biting into such a thing would make my mouth melt! I got the idea from fried okra, and thinking how to put some veggies into the wrap, though coleslaw is a great idea.  
Unfortunately I don't know if there really is an American replacement for seaweed wrap... I was thinking lettuce or cabbage leaves, but what's most characteristic of the seaweed wrap is its ability to kind of cling and keep things together well. Other leaves don't really have that power, or seaweed's flatness... but we should keep brainstorming!
Bacon for seaweed wrap
Im sad that ive only just thought of this as winter has just begun. But im definitely saving this for future endeavors.

The fried sushi thing, that sounds pretty awesome. Fry the whole roll and then slice it. This is getting out of hand, im so hungry now

And hot sauce, oh man.. I love hot sauces. This is perfect
There was a fad in Japan a couple of years ago for hamburgers made exactly like this.

A ball of rice, flattened, fried, cut in half, and a burger put in the middle of it.  It was really good.
MOS Burger makes ok rice burgers! They're my absolute weakness. It's a shame that they're the only ones that sell it...
Msn this thread is making me hungry and this just sealed it 
This [exists](http://i.imgur.com/OAyUleQ.jpg), it's a common Taiwanese food! 

"Da chang bao xiao chang" literally meaning "Big sausage wrapping small sausage"
I guess you could say it was a sausage fest.
Jesus. I rarely comment these days. This one makes me really hungry. 
Rice crispy

Finally getting to this!

Rice crispy: 10/10

Rice crispy with rice: 5/10

Weird taste to be added to rice cripsy. Not the right cereal to be rice'd.
just joining reddit history
What a legend.
You mean not the rice'd cearal... ha I'm funny.
*crispy
Riception
😊
> to be rice'd

you're delightful
Just crisp the rice before adding it to the rice crispy.
Implying that there is a right cereal to be rice-d.
Fruity pebbles were great!
Honey or Maple syrup.
Honey with leftover rice was exactly how we did things growing up.
Maple syrup and scrambled eggs is one of my favorite ways to have rice.
I love maple syrup! I love it on pancakes, I love it on pizza! I love to take maple syrup and put a little bit in my hair when I've had a rough week. What do you think holds it up, slick?
My dad used to put honey in my Spanish rice when I was little because that's the only way I'd actually eat it. Of course, I haven't tried it in years...
Are you kidding me?!?! Do yourself a favor and pour syrup over white rice. It's unbelievable. I swear to god 
Maple syrup: 9/10

Maple syrup with rice: 6/10

Does not go to well, but better than other foods.
I remember eating rice with syrup one time because I ran out of ketchup and wanted to let *something* on it. I had chicken too and thought "hey if people eat chicken and waffles with syrup I can eat chicken and rice with syrup." It did not go as well as I had hoped. 
Wouldn't maple syrup with rice be somewhat like rice pudding? AAGH, NOW I HAVE TO TRY THIS.
I used to eat white rice with a bit of honey.  I found it pretty yummy.
This is sort of funny. I make a maple syrup and soy sauce glaze for salmon that's incredible over rice.
Maple syrup with rice PLUS bacon: omnomnoms
Make sure it's real Grade A Dark Amber, though.  None of that Aunt Jemima crap.
If you try honey I think it's actually pretty good.
When I was younger I used to eat rice with brown sugar! Surprisingly really *really* good. Just make a bowl of white rice, put some butter on top and sprinkle some brown sugar. I still make it every once in a while.
As a Canadian, this saddens me a little. 
Add milk, another rice pudding.
Nah man you did it wrong.

If you make a "breakfast bowl" it can be amazing. Pan fried frice, bacon, eggs, hashbrowns (the "wedge kind" noy the shredded junk") optional, salt, a little pepper, some ginger powder, and a nice drizzle of maple syrup. Soooo good.

I like my anything cooked in a pan yo be a bit crispy, so I cook all of the ingredients separately and then combine them and the seasonings at the end.
Add milk.
This was the only way my elementary school friend ate rice. 
Actually maple syrup, almond butter, and chili paste over rice is a quick and easy goto for me
HELL YEAH

if you add a dollop of marmalade and a packet of soy sauce it becomes Struggle Pad Thai
):
Is it called "whatever the fuck is in the pantry"?
You ever try chicken with rice and drizzle the honey over it? It's tasty. 
[deleted]
Can confirm N64 and Foodoo (spooky food voodoo) always works, when I was a wee lad, me and my friend put spicy pickles and marshmallows into our Kraft Dinner (kraft mac and cheese for you non-Canadians)     it was actually.....surprisingly satisfying.

You should make a site doing nothing but this.


I know I'd go to it.
Or YouTube! You'd make money and people would love it!
Omg seriously, if this was a YouTube show, an episode per week with a different rice combo, this kid would be Internet famous so quickly
But does it go to well?
Start a fuckin kickstarter for him.
Every week I could have a main ingredient and have people tip to see what they want eaten with it. This would be awesome.
That sounds awesome and I love the idea...as long as it's you doing it and not me. Sounds like a literal ton of weird foods would be consumed
You should make a subreddit for it. I would subscribe to it
Might be able to do a Fiver or something, too. Thiat way you don't exhaust your funds on an awesome project. I may be willing to help out doing some of these. Not going to stealyour idea though.
Please do it! I'd follow it every day
Please do this
OMG...they could vote! Is there anything you wouldn't eat? Like fish eyes or deer ass or something? 
Fish eyes is a personal favorite of mine haha
Distusting*
I am un-redditing-adopting you! That is disgusting!
Fish Eyes are fucking delicious, especially tuna
You have found your calling OP.
Start a YouTube channel, become a partner and monetize it. On Subreddit do 7 main ingredients (one for each day of the week) film it each day and upload it, this way you have time to get the ingredients. 

Edit: Profit! 
Do it man! I'd watch that
You are now tagged as "ate stuff on rice" in aqua.
I would subscribe to this as a newsletter or even a subreddit.
You could take bitcoin tips. Pm me if you need help setting it up. 
I don't want any sort of money from this, just adsense that I make off Youtube. Thanks though!
Honestly it could be a cool way to do this as it would put a priority on things.  For example, I propose something for someone to eat and then I put up $1.  If it occurs then the money gets sent.  You could open this up so anyone can be on the supply/demand side.
/r/withrice
Promoting? Hmm...I'll just leave this here... /r/pressfarttocontinue
Yay! I am now a moderator of an awesome sub!
Can I be a mod? I don't even spaghetti but I can yogurt pretty good (is that nasty)
Ask the owner of the sub (:
you're going to become a legend at your local grocery store.

[deleted]
Hey, if the guys from Wreckless Eating can get paid to vomit on camera, OP could be a star.
[deleted]
I'd subscribe.
He could be the next "Howtobasic", but with him actually eating it, so basically "Maxmofoe".
Yaaaa I'm thinking unless it was a huge success that he would spend more money on the ingredients. To prove my point I will suggest filet mignon and swordfish when the site is up and running.
HowToBasic?
Unintentional spaghetti joke because OP's username?
Don't you only get paid if the video is more than 30 seconds, though?
This. I demand Youtube videos. 
OP... Do this... You can make lots of money I'd watch it all.
I think that's called a Vine.
As a web developer with a film degree and someone who loves rice, I really should do this.

Edit: That's more upvotes than I suspected. BRB, making rice.
And I shall be your trusty side kick during the development process! 

Unless you meant you're a web DESIGNER, in which case I'd code that server shit :D
I never know what to call myself. I can do both, but am definitely stronger at the coding part. When people ask what I do, I usually just say, "I make websites."
Then I'll be your trusty sidekick!
It needs a catchy name. Like "Will it blend?" but for pairing weird ingredients with rice.
I have what I think to be a decently clever name. Maybe I'll actually do this. It certainly sounds like fun.
If you do, come back here and link it. I'll watch it.
you could fill those pockets with anything your dreams desire

such as rice
such as seals
Marshmallows 
So... Rice ~~crispy~~ treats
Marshmallows: 10/10

Marshmallows with rice: 8/10


Pretty nice.
Pretty... *rice*
Everything with rice is pretty nice
I imagine that as an Asian rice crispy treat
You're not even going to thank him? Rude!
Nice Rice
Euuww.
I can't eat rice, and for that.. Urg! I bet that was good. 
Pretty rice.
Doritos, or any kind of chips really. Nachos or corn chips would probably be the worst. 

Also, do you live in a grocery store?  You have like everything on hand right now.


EDIT: i change my answer. jello would be much worse than doritos.

Crisps*
Sorry.


- Canada
Thanks haha :P
Have you never had a frito pie with rice??? Shit is delicious!!!! 
No chips with rice are the bomb! Like lays for example, sour cream and onion, cheddar cheese, barbeque, yummm.
Crunch up some doritos add them to a burrito
One of my favorite foods to make, eat, and then feel guilty about eating is dorito riceballs.

In my experience, it works best to use sweet chili flavor and add tabasco sauce generously.  It is extremely delicious.  Also very bad for you.
In OPs defense most of these things I have in my flat. Not all obviously but I could do a decent portion of these without having to go out. 
Leading up to and during finals, when I become subhuman for a couple of weeks, I've been known to cook rice and crack open some Pringles. It's actually pretty good.
Corn chips with rice = bad?

Every time I eat nachos I make sure to scoop some rice onto them.
Yeah I thought about it for a few minutes after I posted it and realized that I just don't really like corn chips so I was biased. My new answer is jell-o.
Nacho cheese doritos: 10/10

Cool ranch doritos: 10/10

Nacho cheese doritos with rice: 7/10

Cool ranch doritos with rice: 7/10

These are both really tasty but would make you think what is wrong with your life.

And I live a few steps from the store, so I can just go outside and grab some stuff.
Do you live in the Philippines?  They've got stores right next to each house.

^(Pls respond)
Nope, USA, or whatever its called.
Oh, okay.

Thanks for responding, almighty god of 100000+ karma-in-one-single-day OP.
Hot cheetos is pretty good
When we have Chili con Carne, we always buy some tortilla chips to go with it, and more often than not, we buy Cool Original Doritos to go with it. I can say rice + Doritos is really nice.
This gave me an amazing idea... Rice, salsa, black beans and guacamole- wait that's 4 later dip damn it
I wish I had a friend like you. You're awesome.
Whenever I have leftover rice and a bag of chips with my lunch, I like to use my rice as a sort of chip dip. 

Nacho cheese Doritos with rice: 10/10

Cool ranch Doritos with rice: 10/10

Fritos with rice: 10/10

Lays potato chips with rice: 10/10

Cheetos with rice: 10/10

Tortilla chips with rice: 10/10

Funyuns with rice: 10/10

Pringles with rice: 10/10
I want to try fritos with rice... Really bad.
Dammit. This made me miss home. No Fritos in Korea.

Otherwise Fritos and rice definitely. And ground beef, cheddar cheese, hot salsa, onions, and pinto beans.
You did it wrong scrub. You put the doritos in a paper bag, smash them and then grind them into a powder like substance and mix it in with the rice.

If you did it right you'd say 10/10. I bet you ate the rice with the chip like a scoop as if you were some kind of savage.

Will try better next time.
And pay for it...right?
Of course! I'm rich. No I'm not I lied.
"Joey, that weird dude is here *again*. This time he's buying hot dogs, doritos, nutella and another bag of rice."
We need an AMA of someone working at that store.
They probably just think he's a stoner.  
They're gonna think he's got the weirdest case of the munchies. 
I went to the store so many times so here's pretty much their reactions:


First time, oh hey you're buying stuff.

Third, oh look its you buying stuff again...

Fifth, okay I can tell something is wrong with you.

And every time after that they just look at me and I stare them in the eye and say nothing.
Weed is a hell of a drug.
Your mom funded this right? Unless you have a job at 14. Then I'll cry. Cause I don't have a job. 
In the eye? The *EYE*? 

Is everyone at your local store a cyclops?!
You. I like you.
Well I like you too!
Eye contact and silence is to assert your dominance. 
Make direct eye contact and assert your alpha male dominance.
Where are you getting money for this
14 and asserting your dominance. I like it
You're a good person. Don't let your parents ever tell you otherwise.
Like a boss no doubt
They probably just assume you're high as fuck. 
Fuckin alpha male here, showing his dominance to the cashier

Also how much did this cost you so far?
Twelfth time: "Hey, are you that kid from Reddit trying weird stuff on rice?"
You remind me of my buddy from work.  He does shit like that.  Just dead stares you in the eye while he does weird shit.

I fucking love that kid.
I love doing that!
I need to learn this trick.
Oh my god I love you OP
If I was a 14 year old girl I would date him based on the size of his balls alone.

Who needs logic when you can get internet points that do nothing?
How can you be fourteen? Can't believe this.

Ok, I'm impressed with how much you've gotten gilded in this thread. Most I've seen since that guy.... Hey, wait a second, new suggestion inbound.

Well that was quick.

I added a link, too. It's more a joke than anything, but it's up to you.

M-maybe rice helps?
You're gonna go far, kid!

Thanks! It's good to know that I made your day happy :)
We thank you together for making this good bender
I'm not even mad that an OP 11 years my junior is more entertaining than I ever have been or will be on reddit.

Chocolate-covered bacon.
This one sounded fun to make!

Chocolate covered bacon = 9/10

Chocolate covered bacon with rice = 6/10

Doesn't really go too well together...
Dude. It's bacon. Your statement was invalid before you even made it.
Thank you for your suggestion.
dang, this one blew my mind the most.  Bacon and rice is like a 12/10
Bull shit. This is the meal of the gods.
Can confirm. Had this two days ago.
Thank you for your suggestion.
Thank you for your suggestion.
Thanks you for your suggestion. 
You should still thank him for his suggestion...
Wait chocolate covered bacon only gets 9/10? I'm beginning to question the accuracy of your ratings...
Chocolate covered bacon is actually gross. Don't try it.
Too late and it's incredibly delicious... I don't know what you're talking about 
Bacon and rice is pretty good tho
Fried rice is where it's at.
A bbq place near me sells bacon friend rice...with bacon. 
It helps if you keep a bit of the grease and mix it in. Pork, fat, tomatoes, fresh basil, and some peppers to kick it up a bit. Fresh lime juice and soy sauce are good to season a bit more.

This goes well with leftover turkey or ham if you shred it. Substitute rice for fried hominy and it's great too.
Bok choy stir fried with bacon over rice. Make some black chicken along with it, and holy shit.
What if you cant cook? How to black chicken?
Shit, was not expecting this thread to still be alive. [Here is one article on it](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12040-black-skinned-chicken-slow-cooked-in-dark-soy-sauce). You can also use a slow cooker.
Just because X and Y are good together, X and Z are good together, and Y and Z are good together does not make X, Y, and Z good together. In high school, my friends and I made some homemade ice cream. We mixed chocolate(X) with banana(Y) and orange (Z). The result was very unappetizing. 
Is chocolate even good with orange ?
Orange and choco is the shit m8y
You mean bacon, rice, egg, and vinegar. Filipino, son. 
>Bacon and __________ is pretty good. 


Oath. For breakfast sometimes my pop and I'll cook up eggs over-easy, fry up some Spam or bacon, then lay all of that over leftover rice. Dat Asian comfort food. 
Fuck yeah! Eggs, bacon, and rice together? Shit's delicious
Filipino here, bacon and rice is a pretty normal meal. Usually my family has it for breakfast.
Can confirm. 
[deleted]
Could you teach me the recipe.? Am broke ass student 

That sounds fucking delicious. 
Holy cow, broccoli cheddar rice sounds delicious. Why have I never heard of this before?
SERIOUSLY!?

Where are you from? Because it sure ain't 'merica!
There's a cheesy broccoli with rice Veggie Steamer that is one of my favorite gross frozen foods for dieting.
Well someone sure as hell didn't grow up in the Midwest.
Yeah, I didn't. Born and raised in California.

But now I'm going to go try this rice out. Can't wait to taste it!

Thanks! Guess I'll be trying out a new recipe tomorrow :)
Pancakes
Patella Pancakes?

That sounds really good, actually.
That is what I immediately thought of. Cool to know others think alike!
This is an actual Asian dish. Should be pretty decent. 
Have you ever had egg foo young?  That will change your life. 
Pancakes: 10/10

Pancakes with rice cooked inside: 10/10

This is amazing. I like.
Pancakes with avocado slices. Best surprise.
Way late to the thread, but my grandma used to make 'rice pancakes' with rice mixed into the batter.

Man, I haven't had those in years. Now I want some.
> Pancakes with rice cooked inside: 10/10

Isn't that a burrito?
With or without syrup?
There are so many ways to eat this. Pancakes with rice and mushrooms or chicken for example, or vegetables, pineapple, some good sauce... it's just a good combo.
What's your recipe ?
Did you cook the rice before or with the pancakes? 
With.
Ew 
It's surprisingly really good.
you can also mix cooked rice with eggs and make something similar to pancakes by throwing the resulting batter on the stove.  Quite tasty with maple syrup.
My grandmother taught me this actually. I love it.
Try to adding minced hard-boiled egg. Will be even better.
Please allow me [to be of service](http://www.closetcooking.com/2009/05/okonomiyaki-japanese-pancake.html) to OP.
Did you roll the pancake up with rice? You should set up a live stream for this, its criminal that we're left here imagining
I put pancake batter, mixed rice in, and made pancakes!
Should I add syrup? Or would it fuck it up?
Feel free to do whatever you think would be the best!
Will do! :)
YOU ARE A GOD SON, NOTHING SHORT
Did you use steamed rice and mix it in the batter?
I hope so
OP?
Alright that sounds good. will try.
Put nutella on it
Deliver.
You really want the Captain to deliver you some gorram pancakes? Well, long as you're payin'.
Op pls deliverino
What makes you think he's deliver rice pancakes all the way to you??
Because he's Mal Reynolds and will do anything for money and his crew
A Kickstarter?
I think they're neighbors. Or they're like Unidan
I deliver pancakes to fat people for money on tuesdays.
This is awesome. 
It's tuesday here in my place. Please deliver.
Oh okay on my way!
Living the dream
Did you really make pancakes with rice inside? Can we see pictures of these items accompanied by rice?
Yeah, I'm wondering if he put cooked rice in the pancake batter or if you put rice on the pancake and then folded it over itself. Or something else.
Not sure about that either, surprised he's getting so much praise with no proof, especially on reddit, weird.
You'd probably make more money delivering pancakes to people on Fat Tuesday. 
missed that one at the job fair
What if I'm not fat but I want pancakes on Wednesdays?
You must be fat.
server at IHOP?
Wait is that even a thing?

Wait yes.
I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a pancake with rice today. 
Not Wednesdays? :(
I will on a wednesday just for you!
Omg yes. If you don't I will. 
Why not skinny people? Skinny people like pancakes too!
bullshit, if they really did like pancakes they would be fat
skinny people get them hemselves
He doesn't like skinny people.
Are they always fat, or do you make them that way?
Yes
Yes
What's gonna work? TEAM work!
Yes
Are you one of his victims? How fat are you? Pics or it didn't happen!
Coca cola 
Go Straight to Hell, Boy
Coca cola: 10/10

Coca cola over rice: 7/10

Gives the rice a fizzy taste but isn't too awful.

Thank you for your suggestion.
I've actually tried this once. It's not bad at all.
....how much rice do you have?
I'm beginning to question your food rating ability.
Was the rice cooked in coke or just mixed in it?
why didn't you BOIL the rice in COCA COLA?!
IS THIS A THING?
It actually is, yes, you are meant to actually boil the rice in Coca Cola. Sounds tasty to me. 

http://www.cocinasemana.com/recetas/receta/arroz-coca-cola-pasas/19912
I've been looking for a good fizzy taste lately...
Fries with ketchup.
Do you have really low standards of food or something? Because you're rating things really high that I would think would be disgusting.
I really wish you were taking pictures of all of these and compiling an album along with your reactions to each of them. 
What kinda nasty shit ass foods do you normally eat OP?? Gross
FYI, next time you're making fried rice, a minute before it's ready pour some coke into it. Let the liquid boil out.  I think it tastes awesome.

Also, just had fried rice for dinner.
in my country ( Colombia ) there's a dish called rice with coca cola and is actually really nice, you could try it
edit: word
Yup, cooking rice and/or meat with coca cola is good.  
Source: am from Colombia too.
I've lived here in Colombia for nearly 7 years and haver never heard of this...wat?
Arroz con coco. It's from the Atlantic region.
Oh, yes! But it's with coconut...
Among the ingredients that you add to make the rice sweet, coca cola is one of them.
I've never been to Colombia but I have honestly heard of this. It's a thing, just Google it. 

http://www.cocinasemana.com/recetas/receta/arroz-coca-cola-pasas/19912

I am *presuming* this is not some Colombian in joke on foreigners like drop bears but honestly rice and Coca Cola does sound plausible to me. 
Try it. Trust me... maybe remove the raisings and add meat for a non-probably dessert material.  
Source: am from Colombia.
>and is actually really rice

FTFY

Rice with coca cola is such an elegant name
Omg yes my patents eat this. And chicken cooked with coke. It's also similar to arros con coco.
Mmm I haven't made cola chicken in years - so good...

We tried Dr.pepper chicken once... It was just weird spotted slightly peppery chicken... Not good
Tbh I don't like the coke foods. But I eat them for my Mom.
Yea its a once every ten years or so thing with me - though actually I imagine pork ribs might be good with a thick coke and 5 spice sauce...
I think he just did 
What's in it?
I'm guessing its a mixture of quinoa and mountain dew.
Thanks 
What kinda coke are we talking about here?
He said coka cola. The "a" at the end of the words denotes femininity. 

So coke that came out a Colombian woman's asshole.
2 kilos of Columbian bam bam
Meth coke?
Well, Mexican coke is pretty tasty I guess. So I would guess that coke will do. 
Heroin.
Well he said coca cola so I'm guessing it coca cola.
he also said columbia
Not sure if you know this but coke makes a different flavor for many countries. Some are very similar to cola while some are a near coffee flavor. There is a coke exhibit in Atlanta (World of coke) that has tons of different, and mostly awful, flavors of coke.
You're *ruining* it man.

Cocaine

Merchant powder
Ice!
Is Pepsi OK? 
Coca Colambia?
Hey well u got vanilla coke, cherry coke, cherry vanilla... And many more Kappa
Did it always say coca cola? I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure it said coke before
Cola, short for Columbia. 
I'm not quite sure if this is a typo or intentional, but it's hilarious. 
typo :(         
          
I guess I'll just leave it there
Colombian Coke
Soda's not the first thing to come to mind when I read that.....Theres a joke sitting there waiting to happen.....Oh well someone else can figure it out.
Hmmm....
Colombian candy*
There are actually different formulas for coke for different countries, for example, German Coca-Cola tastes noticeably different from American.
They add a little more mein fuerer to it than us Americans are used to. 
It's the lack of high fructose corn syrup, usually.
That cleared things up.. No.. Wait. 
1000000/10
Ooh that calms the shakes real nice...

Well holy fuck, I was halfway to assuming you were a bullshitter:

Pizza
My friend from high school used to get orders of fried rice from Panda Express and then dump it on to a Me-N-Edd's pizza. Was pretty glorious but you gave yo be ready to come off as a Shaggy-level stoner.
I used to eat pizza with 'sticky' rice once. It's not so bad.
Might not be that bad with thin crust and mucho cheese
I see no problem with this one. Asian here.
Week old pizza hut leftovers: 9/10

Week old pizza hut leftovers with rice: 8/10

I put the rice on the cheese and heated the cheese so the rice was in it, it actually was not to bad.
I had sushi on my pizza once when really high. It was good. 
I'm calling B.S., no one has pizza hut leftovers for a week. 
I mean I bought 2 whole pizzas for myself and hid them from my family.
Are you actually eating these things or are you doing this based off of opinion? If you have the rice the same age as the pizza hut leftovers, it's then more accurate.

There's a reason the italians don't eat rice.
No there isn't, because they do. Quite a bit, actually.
Arancini is the bomb.. Whut u say?? 
Italians eat rice.

Source: am italian, eat rice.
Yea they just call it risotto. 
I am catching so much flak for assuming that italians only eat pasta and pizza.
Well, you know, assuming.
> If you have the rice the same age as the pizza hut leftovers, it's then more accurate.

Doesn't rice go off? I think I remember getting pretty harsh food poisoning from rice that was a few days old in my fridge.
No.  Rice doesn't go bad, really, unless it's damp and warm. Then it molds over pretty quickly. If you ate it with something else, it was that something else. If you ate it alone, however, it was immaculate food poisoning. 
I've left rice in the fridge for a week after i left it in the pot for a day with no problems 
No. I've eaten rice that was a few weeks old. It can mold but it shouldn't rot unless it's super soggy. 
He should totally eat it at this age ;)
No..it can last several days in the fridge. Was probably something else that gave you the food poisoning, unless the rice was left out for a long time before being refrigerated. 
Around a week though and it tends to smell funny and not have the same texture.
> There's a reason the italians don't eat rice.

What do you think risotto is?
Is it spelled r-i-c-e?
Risotto is rice's super awesome cousin. 
Tiny pasta.
It's usually arborio rice
I take a few bites of the food, by itself.

Then I add rice and took a few more bites.
How much rice did you cook?
Do you ever have those moments where you're like okay this is like a cup of rice but it turns out to be like 10 pounds? 


That was me.
Wow. I wouldn't want to be your toilet tomorrow, my starchy friend.
I wouldn't want to be OP's sphincter then either.
> Week old pizza hut leftovers: 9/10

If you mark that 9/10, your 5/10 ratings must really taste like shit.
I don't know about a week old, but reheated pizza is amazing. 
I want you to know- If I weren't so poor, I would have gilded you for this. It got to me.
Seriously. Fresh Pizza Hut lies around a 6 for me
Well...fresh pizza hut starts at 3/10, so there must be a bell curve somewhere
This comment wins. Congrats 
Cold pizza is better than hot pizza.
Old pizza > pizza 
Oddly enough, I would rank Pizza Hut pizza at about a 2/10, but week old Pizza Hut pizza would be closer to a 7/10.
There is a pizza place by my house that was good a weak and a half later...
Shit: 5/10

Shit with rice: 6/10

I put the rice in the shit and it improved it a little.

Thank you for your suggestion.
Cold pizza is luuurvely.

Mind you, cold pizza a week old is brave.
Oh look at mr im too good to eat week old pizza over here
Or maybe ~~Pizza Hut~~  pizza is just that good?
I...I actually like Pizza Hut.
I do too. But after day 3 I'm over that shit. 
I'm more curious as to how the pizza lasted 7 days before being finished off.
That's a really good question. 
Not as good as babycakes?
Nothing will ever be as good as babycakes. 
Cold pizza is automatically 9/10 regardless
He has the ign rating system perfected.

7.5/10 - this pizza is literally hitler
Figuratively Hitler.
Too much water on that pizza.
7/10- too much water
I'm scared for the 2/10 I saw earlier
Crusty pussy scab I pulled off my knee 2/10

At first I thought "pussy" meant something else there...

Fuck pickles over rice. 2/10
An pickles?
I'm scared for his arse in the morning. This shit ain't gonna end well...
1/10 must be death. 
He gave soggy bread (plain) a 1/10.  
0.0
Dear god...what was it made of? What had it been soaked in?

On second thought, i don't want to know
well, he needed something to do with his cumbox...
Please

Pickles
I think pickles actually work because sushi has pickled cucumber in it sometimes
What about Kimchi?
I have to chuckle. This is an amazing example of how different people feel about food in different countries. For the majority of people including me, here in Czech Republic to be specific, we enjoy eating meals that include rice and pickles. We even have a special meal that has pickles chopped up in the gravy!
I'm asian and we eat pickles with rice all the time.

Only it's more like kimchi
Most Asian cuisine consists of some variety of pickled vegetables and from personal experience goes quite well with rice.
Korea would like a word with you.  Their diet is basically pickles and rice
Pickles and rice are both part of some traditional indonesian dishes
Pickles with rice sounds really fuckin good
Chop your favorite pickles and toss them into some rice, then press into rice balls. Tasty, cheap, filling lunchtime snack. If you leave the rice balls in the fridge too long and they get a little stale fry them a bit with some soy sauce.
Good God that sounds delicious and I may just do it right now
I just make a huge pot of rice on Sunday and make rice balls like this for the whole week. Chopped up smoked salmon is also a great filling.
Rice....balls..... Hmmmmmm
 I hate pickles honestly but I guess I'm willing to.

Pickles: 1/10

Pickles with rice: 2/10

I like rice.
Indian here, try curd rice with mango pickle. We practically live on the stuff. (Yes, I know you're talking about pickled gherkins, but srsly)
dude piklz are bomb
Ok, clarification, in India what we call pickles is this really hot and spicy side dish made from mangoes or lemons or garlic or chillies or just abt anything out there. Now, this stuff, is God's gift when had with rice, especially rice mixed with curd (yoghurt).
Dude Pickles are fucking delicious... try Kosher Deli pickles your mind will change.
I hate pickles but I love pickles with rice and butter. It is honestly the only way I can eat pickles. Try it.
That sounds so fucking bizarre... idek what to think about that kind of thing. 
This whole thread is great, but this one killed me. Especially that last line. Thank you /u/DO_U_EVN_SPAGHETTI, I salute you!
I'm happy you enjoyed it~!
11/10.

Would upvote again.
I want to believe you tried a pickle again for this just to give it a 1/10 and not basing it off how you felt about pickles before; the integrity of this thread has been compromised.
I feel personally offended that you would rate pickles 1/10.
I eat (Japanese) pickles over rice all the time and it's amazing.
Gonna say... Japanee... Gonna eat their pickle and rice. HELLO!!!!!
Japanese pickles say whaaaaat?!?! 
This is the one that made me start laughing out loud.
This thread is amazing.
Thanks for taking one for the team.
I love how pickles has the same rating as soggy bread.
> I hate pickles

Good man.

And I always feel like a crotchety old man when I want to tell them about the early days of the internet. * there's only one way *
I honestly feel like there should be a place for these new users to go in order to be taught by those few who remember the beginning of it all. They will be taught the correct ways. Correct grammar and smilies that are not emojis. What ever happened to the bowtie man?! How can we keep falling for these idols of false faces? It's not the correct way. They are losing their path. Someone needs to step forth as a teacher to the future generations of the intranet faith. To teach the glorious way it was. Like not being able to use the internet and phone at the same time. The dial up noise that haunted dreams. The joy of seeing your friend pop up on AIM or MSN messenger. That Nokia flip phone that didn't even have a camera let alone Google search access or siri. The horror of picking out your to 8 on myspace. The way it was in the beginning should be kept sacred forever and ever. amen

Have you done butter, milk, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg on warm rice?
Those ingredients would be good on anything !! 
Yogurt.
I actually eat this combination as a snack commonly
In Pakistan, we fry rice in onions and eat it with plain yogurt. It's delicious 
Or "rice pudding" as it's more commonly known 
Till my late teens, I don't think I had rice with anything other than yogurt OR tomato sauce.. And significantly more often with yogurt. It is actually really nice..
They sell yogurt mixed with rice here in Central Europe in stores. It's called "Milky rice" and it's great!
Isn't that just tapioca?
I would have said frozen yogurt.
Came to say this. Damn you for beating me to it.
I never jerked you off to yogurt! That must've been my clone.
I'm Lebanese and we actually have a dish of rice with yogurt :) 
You know over 1 billion people eat rice with yogurt frequently right?
This is super common in India, almost all of us do it.
Curd rice is a thing in India though

Lol yogurt rice is actually something eaten commonly in India usually at the end of a meal. It's amazing with banana or mango.
Blasphemy. Salt or pickle take your pick. Ain't no fruit goin' nearing my curd rice. 
mangos4lyfe
My parents eat it with ripe mango. It's weird and I am not a fan. 
Yeah, I think it tastes weird because its not inherently sweet and is usually kind of sour. If you mix fruit in, it starts tasting sweet/sour in a strange way and has a odd texture to it. 
K you needa get that proper dahi idk why yours is so sour
It tastes fine for like a day or two. But I like to make raita out of it so it gets sour. 
Persians sometimes like to eat their rice with yogurt salad mixed in. 
I enjoy eating plain yogurt with rice.
I imagine it tastes like rice pudding...
I enjoy eating pain human with rice
Do you enjoy being desi?
Actually, I'm not east indian.
He's using geneticist magic to determine his heritage! Don't let this man fool you!

Yoplait Yogurt: 10/10

Yoplait Yogurt with rice: 9/10

really weird but kind of tastes like a foreign dessert.
Perhaps I'll try that one day!
What? I eat rice with yogurt whenever I can. Delicious.
Rice pudding!
You should try rice pudding. It is basically the same without shitty yogurt. 
Rice pudding with a little cinnamon or nutmeg, allspice or pumpkin pie spice.   Yum!


Maybe tastes like a tapioca pudding I bet?
I know my Indian friend ate yogurt with any Indian food he ate and most of it included rice. I guess it's really good with the spiciness though he never really had a problem with that
> .

My parents who are from India actually really enjoyed this, growing up.
[deleted]
Fellow South Indian high five! 
Holy jesus that looks good.
I dont know if it is because my Mother is from Iran but i always had yogurt with my Rice.
Rice pudding?
South Asians eat plain yogurt + rice on the regular. I imagine the Yoplait alternative tastes a bit like rice pudding.
plain curd rice is a bit boring... you have to add the tempering! (fry whole spices in oil / ghee add curry leaves and mix into the curd rice)
Yup! It's tastes sorta sour but with other good that taste sweet or spicy, it really is great. 
That actually sounds pretty close to kheer. Find a kheer recipe and cook some up. Yum.
khesar keer is probably one of my true weaknesses for dessert. I usually don't have a sweet tooth, but you put me within sight-distance or smell distance of it, and  I will devour it like there is no tomorrow.
kheeeeeeer i love kheer. my mommy makes the best kheer ever.
no, mine does!
I'd say mine does, but lately my mom's been a fuckin idiot and started adding raisins. Like why? Who the fuck likes raisins? 
It's pretty staple in India, specifically South India.  It's called 'curd rice' where they use buttermilk/yogurt with a bit of green chilli, popped mustard seeds and ginger.

Try rice with salted buttermilk.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curd_rice
fucknig love this shit. I started making my own curd from the last bit of a tub I bought at the store, and now I'm onto the 5th generation of it... I make curd rice for lunch sometimes, or i serve it with pickle as an accompaniment to my masalas.... hot damn I love this shit. almost as much as I love raita...
I'm white, but I live in a very Indian area, and honestly for all the shit people talk about Indian food most of it is pretty fucking good. 
Who talks shit on Indian food?
Most white people. 
Then they're missing out!
Man I must live in the wrong area because all the white people here love Indian food. They even liked my mom's cooking and her dishes are usually way more Indian then the Indian restaurants in the area. 
People with shitty digestive tracts that can't handle curry.
I read this thread entirely too long
me too! It's almost midnight...
I'd been reading this thread for 20 minutes before I reached your comment. Thank you, internet stranger from two weeks ago. I have been reminded that there is life beyond imagining various foods with rice.
It's midnight here and just got to this comment.... I need to stop/sleep.
No regrets
I'm here too man. Worth the read. Rice is now one of my top 3 foods.
I'm right down here with you. 
Dude I started at 10:20 am and its 11:21 and I have not left this thread at all.
Oops well atleast now you know what to eat!
What not to eat*
/u/blisssster is still reading this thread. May die soon.

*should have eaten some rice while reading*
Rice?
Or what not to eat.
Soggy bread? It came like 1st out of 10.
I will definitely try most of the higher rated ones myself.
Oranges.
Mandarin oranges are delicious over rice! Especially when cooked with a little Kung pao sauce on a skillet.
God, I hate to actually defend this...But, in the Midwest, there is the "funeral dessert" that church-ladies make that is made up of cooked rice, cool-whip, and canned oranges.  I'll be damned if it isn't quite good in that combination.  
Yikes!
there is a Persian dish that has orange peels and rice. it's pretty amazing. 

http://cookingandcooking.com/recipe.php?recname=Shirin-Polow,-Persian-Orange-Rice
Upping the ante on this one: orange juice with heavy pulp.
That was going to be my suggestion. 
And minty toothpaste.
OP said disturbing, not traumatizing.
How is that tasty?
It isnt supposed to be.
I don't know, God, have you ever tried it? It might taste good. Maybe Jesus will like it.  
(It's your username.)
 > Jesus

Wrong god. :/
chicken, cooked in oranges, orange juice, oregano, and basil is fantastically delicious over rice.  
Remind Me! 4 days 
If you cook the rice in 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 water (cook as you normally cook rice), it's pretty good. Save some orange zest to sprinkle on the rice for added flavour when serving. Fruity rice goes with only so many dishes though, best with something spicy or savory, always good with chicken of almost any kind. 
Holy shit that sounds amazing wtf have i been doing with my life D:
I don't understand people who *don't* like pulp. OJ with heavy pulp sounds wonderful to me!
Oh it is, but with rice? Slimy sticky mush.
Well, yeah, on rice it probably wouldn't be very good.
It's good if it's actual pulp, but it seems like a lot of them just throw ground-up rind in there and it's not very good. Lots of real pulp is nice.
Ugh, that would be horrible! Real pulp is the only way to go.
Yes! Best thing ever! (Just not with rice).
Oj with pulp is the worst goddamn thing ever. I don't want my juice to have little bits of bullshit floating around in there. 
And anyone that says differently is a goddamn fucking liar
I mean, if you'd rather have diabetes instead of fiber, be my guest.
[Citation needed.]
>Our findings suggest the presence of heterogeneity in the associations between individual fruit consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes. Greater consumption of specific whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples, is significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk.

Peer-reviewed, published in a scholarly journal, and [primary source](http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5001). The authors even correct their findings in a later paper after realizing an error (it didn't affect the outcome).
That sounds like a *bit* of an extreme to me...
I meant it mostly as a tongue-in-cheek comment, but it's not entirely off-base. It's my understanding that OJ is definitely one of the better fruit juices to drink (because of the type of sugar it has in it compared to other fruit juices), but there are countless studies that show consuming none of the fiber and only the juice is not as healthy as consuming all of it.

Edit: Forgot a word.
Plus you poop better! Trust me. 
Get the hell out.
Oranges: 10/10!

Oranges with rice: 4/10

This is not a good one.
wait, wtf...orange juice with rice is delightful.
TIL I don't go well with rice.
But orange chicken...
I've tried this, I don't remember why, but I agree. Not that good. 
Orange chicken with rice: 11/10
They do have sweet rice for desserts.
Tgif has a dragonfire chicken meal that has mandarin oranges and chicken over rice, actually tastes quite good..I think it might just be the spiciness of the sauce pulling the sweet citric flavor of the oranges together with the rice...try it sometime :) 
You must be nuts to not like orange and rice. It's delicious. Add a bit of sugar though.
the funny thing is that i have had orange chicken which comes over rice, and the orange flavor really tastes like shit with rice.
10 out of 3628800 isn't that good.
Factorial joke achieved. Was looking for this.
I think we all were.
10/3628800 doesn't seem to be that good either. :P
This is actually a traditional Scandinavian Christmas special with origin in Denmark.

You mix cold rice porridge with whipped cream, sugar and vanilla.
In my home (swede) we add concentrated orange juice and actual pieces of oranges.
Do this and you get what we (in my home) call "Ris á la malta" 

It's origin from Denmark is called "risalamande".
orange chicken with rice 11/10, how do you explain this?!
chicken
Add beans, I'm Brazilian and oranges complements feijoada really well. Feijoada is a dish consisting of beans and pork, that's usually complemented with rice and well, Oranges.

The beans help mask the weird texture of the rice, and the orange adds a nice sweet taste to the beans.
You must not have done it right. Dried oranges + rice, steamed together, is fantastic. Sometimes a little jalepeno.

He wasn't thankful for it.

Chocolate.

Edit: Okay guys, I get it. I'm going to go and eat some rice with chocolate now.
Hehe  Like the way some restaurants put a sauce that's way too sweet on the risotto.
What about choco ice cream filled mochi? It's super good.
Seriously? Chocolate rice pudding? Delicious! Chocolate oatmeal is also pretty good.
A Filipino dish called Champorado is literally chocolate and rice. Search it up!
That's a crunch bar.
We, Filipinos have a breakfast food of sticky rice cooked with chocolate. Champorado as it is called. It is often mixed with evaporated milk and sugar. 

Really agree with the 9/10. If cooked properly, it could have been 10/10. 
I'd argue that one. Be right back, gotta find rice and chocolate
I have a filipino mom, I *guarantee* you that it's good.
[Give this a shot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champorado)

I promise it's delicious! 
Ever heard of a hersheys crunch bar??
We have a breakfast here called champerado. It's chocolate rice, and it's delicious.
When I was growing up in the Philippines, one of my favorite comfort food as a child is rice with powdered chocolate  (Milo), sugar, or powdered milk.
Crunch bar begs to differ 
Bitch please, everything tastes good with chocolate. I put chocolate on my ketchup to make it taste better.
I don't know, I think [Rice Pudding](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/marcela-valladolid/mexican-rice-pudding-arroz-con-leche-recipe.html) could taste good with chocolate.
Tres leches rice? 
But [it's a thing!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champorado). And it's really good 
lol! almost said this!
It looks like a dookie
Goddammit. Now I want some. 
FUCKING YES. Amazing during the winter time especially. My mom makes it with hersheys cocoa powder, and in a pinch she'll use nesquik powder. Fucking glorious. She texted me and told me she made champorado one winter evening and even though I was at work I was like fuck it and ran the entire would have been 50 minute train ride back home and only regretted it like 40% and then maybe 10% more when the angry texts from my boss started erupting on my phone but no matter, it was champoradope
Hershey's chocolate syrup: 10/10

Hershey's chocolate syrup over rice: 8/10

This one was surprisingly better than I thought.

Thank you for your suggestion.
You can buy chocolate flavoured creamed rice from a super market. Dunno what this guy expected
we eat chocalate porridge for breakfast in my country, chocolate + rice [9/10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champorado)
OP, I'm jealous of all of this food you have in your fridge.
Was it like chocolate rice pudding?
I need this. 
Somewhat similar, except a lot shittier.
real melted chocolate?
This isn't really relevant, but my great grandma likes eating rice and jam, and it actually tastes better than one would expect
You must be 14 you never get full
Actually a thing, Champorado - Filipino chocolate rice. Favorite childhood breakfast.
Hershey's chocolate syrup is about as far from chocolate as you can get. 
I don't know if it's an American thing but I eat Hershey's chocolate and I like it. Is there a meme going around bashing Hershey's or am I in the minority and chocolate isn't suppose to taste like that?
Most Europeans apparently think it tastes like vomit or spoiled milk. Which, IMO, it does if you restrict your chocolate intake to Ghirardelli squares and Ferrero Rochers around the holidays. (I'm American, then again, I've never been able to eat Hershey's chocolate on its own.) 

So why the taste? In the 1800s, the only chocolate in the US was out of the average American's financial means because all the recipes utilized really fresh milk, a major reason for the high price. Then Milton Hershey came around and found that you could really cut the price of chocolate to an easily affordable level by using less-than-fresh milk. For a long time, this was the only chocolate in the American consciousness, hence why so many people think that it is what chocolate is supposed to taste like. Even when Hershey's got big enough to use fresh milk in their recipe without raising the price, people got mad and complained that it didn't taste right anymore, so they have to incorporate slightly-spoiled-milk flavoring into their chocolate to retain that 'classic Hershey's taste'. 
Wow thank you you for that quick response. 
Hershey's corn syrup with brown dye!
In the Philippines, we eat chocolate rice porridge, it's hella good. 
We just call it Champorado
You (and anyone reading this) should try molé with chicken and rice.

Molé is basically chocolate and peppers and is fucking. Delicious.

I imagine chocolate syrup on rice just tastes like ratchet-ass molé
Fair enough, genuinely wasn't expecting that.
But aren't crackel candy bars made with rice?
*MURI*! 

That tastes best with peanuts and a drizzle of mustard oil, though. 
crispy rice though..
And it's Krackel you uncultured swine.
that rice is fried and shit or whatever to make it all crispy and shit though
It's dead bugs that give crunch bars their crunch
And shit. 
And shit

Yeah
Sheeeeeiiiiit.
Shit man, scheeeeeeeit
[It's puffed, like the cereal.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffed_grain)
Shit.
Champorado is a dish which is like chocolate rice. Pretty good stuff.
Adding "and shit" to a sentence has got to be the cheapest way to make me laugh.
And shit? 
Do you know what I am saying?

Mustard
I always liked horse radish mustard on rice,
>tasty
>food
I actually add mustard to most of my rice dishes. It gives it a nice, tangy flavor. 
I knew a guy in school that would make a pot of rice and eat it with mustard... I never tried it, concept seemed weird to me.
Mustard: 7/10

Mustard and rice: 7/10

Oddly tasty...
Spicy or yellow?
I believe it. Probably like adding a splash of vinegar to rice.. Mmmm.
Was forced to eat while stranded on a hiking trip. Can confirm the taste. 
Now add a little Ketchup to the Mustardy Rice.
Had honey mustard with rice once. Was ok, probably around 5-6/10.
You should try mustard with Kraft Mac & Cheese. It's oddly good.
I always do ketchup and pepper.  People think i'm weird.
HEY ME TOO! I fucking LOVE ketchup in Mac and cheese. I can't eat it without ketchup, actually. So good. Damn I wish I had some right now.
There was a chicken curry over rice that had mustard in it they used to serve at my work. It was delicious.
I do this all the time with leftover rice that I'm too lazy to heat up and put something legit on. I eat it at work. My wife thinks it is gross.
You sir, are a cadillac of men. 
I very much enjoy leftover rice with packets of Chinese mustard. 
Chinese mustard is too hot for me, but some duck sauce and soy sauce mixed into it is just right.

Damn.  Now I gotta go cook me some rice.
This. I also add sriracha. If I'm feeling really fancy I'll throw in a scrambled egg.
i know this thread is old as fuck, BUT throw in there a raw tomato. Mustard+Tomato is a win-win.
Dijon mustard on raw tomato is heavenly, with or without rice.
there is this very simple tart you can do, spreading some dijon mustard on some kind of pastry (puff pastry or even any kind of savoury shortcrust) and top it off with sliced tomatoes and whatever herb you have. 15 Min at 350 F (180 C) and you are good to go :), best enjoyed at room temperature with your choice of drink! 
I hate mustard and accidently downvoted you out of finely honed negative reactions. It has been fixed, and I felt this comment necessary.
I'd give it a 9/10. Seriously a staple in my diet. (Poor college kid)
Try ketchup too. Just as easy and cheap, and very tasty.
Try almost anything else, mustard has incredibly low calories. 
That was the whole point of me eating it, actually.
Oh, I thought it was frugality like originally stated. I know the food to dollar ratio is incredibly high, but try eating less carbs. 
It started out because it was low calorie, now it's my go-to cheap dressing for anything and everything. 
Damn OP, if you really are eating all this shit you have a lot of cardio to do tomorrow. 
idk, if he's 14, he can eat whatever he wants and be just as skinny...for several more years. Edit: assuming he's skinny.
I don't understand how he has access to all these foods and was able to cook all of it.
He's 14, he doesn't have to do shit. Get 4 hours of sleep and he'll be good as new.
For sure. Probably gonna go to the gym later and do a whole pushup then come eat more.
I thought i saw "gym leader" in the corner of my eye and got really excited. Only to be dissapointed by the fact that im dyslectic
Too bad I am poor I would have given you gold for the A whole pushup thing.
Slow down there Rocky. 
GAAAAIIIIIIIINZZZZZ
>Probably gonna go to the gym later and *WHOOP SOME BROCK ASS* then come eat more.


Ah, so a cock pushup. Good choice
Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do a full pushup, but take it from this old gym rat, I've spent my entire adult life in the gym, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.

If you only train one part of your body (and that's all a single exercise like pushups is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times.

It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine. 

Push-ups basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent, the triceps. What you really want to do is train your entire body, all the major muscle groups (chest, back, abdomen, legs, shoulders and arms) at the same time, over the course of a workout. And don't forget your cardiovascular work! 

I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with exercise, eating right, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make.

But do it right, okay?

My advice, find a good gym, with qualified trainers who will design your programs for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for physical fitness. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).

And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into the gym. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.

Now get out there and do it! :-)


OP on his A game tonight
One whole pushup?! Take it easy OP
You should write a book. The world needs to know about **[CAN EAT MORE]**
Is this from the Simpsons?
Futurama.
DONT DATE ROBOTS!!!
Ahh that's it, thanks!
Ah good. A whole pushup does burn about 2,000 calories, so you're golden. 
Depending on your weight, I guess.
You need to do a real pushup, meaning be in position, drop your arms, pull out phone, lay on stomach browsing reddit for a few hours.
Then eat more. Problem solved.
Don't overtrain, start slow with a girly push-up. 
Do you see how much rice OP is eating? It might take 2000 Calories to lift him a foot.
Yeah OP is golden alright 
4 months golden, yes.
When you've got three tons of rice in your stomach, it sure as hell does.
well, it does if you do it in the 100x gravity capsule that Goku trained in.
That's not true, you have to do them on your fist.... with a baby on your back... ten babies. And a house. 
golden rice?
>so you're golden brown and delicious. 

FTFY

That only works when you push the Earth away from you.
2000 calories = 2 Calories
A 30 second push-up might do the trick. 
Well hey, if his gym is in another state, and he runs there, he'd make that.
Be careful though OP! According to Tumblr all of this is only about 1,400 calories so you'll be burning an extra 600 and become dangerously underweight!
That's kind of unfair, I follow a lot of fitness stuff on tumblr and it's a great motivator for when I feel like sitting around on tumblr or reddit instead of getting my ass to the gym. 
If whole pushup burns 2000 calories, then what does skim pushup burn?
20
This is what all of reddit except r/fit thinks. And r/bodyweightfitness would chime in telling him to do 20, but clapping with a rope tied around his neck, and meanwhile r/bodybuilding would laugh and tell OP to try starting strength and drink a gallon of milk a day with rice.

OP you sound like fun are you single? 
Did you just accidentally hit on a 14 year old? 
She's 17, so it's only like 70% terrible.
She's probably willing due to this kids humor.
I'm her friend, actually. 
Well I'm 14 so if you're not a pedo hmu
I'm 17 it's not that weird I promise. Age is just a number baby. 
Well I'm 5.

Bananas
Actually it taste quite good, my grandmother made me this so i are my rice and i liked. Also it is good with avocado.
No way. Patanones with rice. Awesome Colombian food.
Banana + mango + hot rice + cucumbers + salt + pepper is actually pretty dang good.
when I was in Uni , a guy from Senegal cooked us rice with fried banana and spicy chiken.

It was AMAZING.

(Mafé de poulet)
Banana: 9/10

Banana with rice: 7/10

Might sound really gross but is actually not too shabby.
This is actually the national dish of Somalia or something.
Indeed it is
Mexican style rice with bananas is awesome.
In my country we actually put banana 🍌 with rice for children to make it sweet I guess or so they can swallow it, I don't know.
My grandfather used to eat this. But he had no teeth and didn't want to wear dentures so he can barely chew anything.
So my boyfriend accidentally made banana fried rice once. He said it was the worst thing he's ever eaten. 
Can you please tell me how on earth he accidentally made banana and fried rice? I think he mite of been stoned when he came up with that idea hahaha
The bananas were peeled and frozen so he thought they were hot dogs haha
It's apparently even better if the banana is cut into little chunks and cooked with the rice.  Read about it in "going solo" by Roald Dahl. 
I was just about to mention this.

Loved that book. You know the real reason why he was there was because he was a spy for MI6?
Dude it's been three months since this thread. How did you get here? ?  

My gosh you were right. Also his books in no way show how he much sleeping around he did... wow. 
The dish that makes my "gotta eat a lot today because I have a hard day ahead of me" meal: rice, sliced bananas (raw), cooked ground meat, fried potatoes. Add olive oil. 
I love the word shabby.
There's a plate called "Arroz a la cubana" (Cuban rice), there are a lot of recipes, I let you the most simple:

http://spanishfood.about.com/od/maincourses/r/arrozcubano.htm

The secret is pickup bananas like [this](http://www.newpi.coop/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/dark-bananas.jpg), without mold of course, and these are cheaper than the newer ones.
Try adding some warm milk to that. This combo is a common recipe here in eastern India.
Pretty sure that's the diet of many Somalians. Usually bananas with bread I think. 
Are you even kidding me? In Vietnam, it's absolutely exquisite when you eat rice with fruit like banana or even pineapple, I'm not even kidding, Grandma used to eat like that and then dragged the rest of the family members to her eating habit, it gets addicting quickly :D, and healthy too!
Try frying the banana first. It is heaven.
If by banana you mean plaintain, then fuck yeah.
Cool guy OP, I eat rice w/ banana slices all the time!
So I see I'm not the only one!
OP: you should take a picture of your "experiments"!
I let my friend borrow my webcam for a while, but I might do a similar thread where I eat more foods over something else.

I think he wants to do a video and doesn't have a good enough phone?I want to believe!
You mean phones have cameras now? What'll they think of next?!

"My webcam is broken/stolen/on loan." Calling card of the internet liar.
Even if he is this thread is still funny
He's catfishing us 
Then why the fuck would he say webcam? Like let's be honest, how many people on the interwebs even use fucking webcams now a days? What is this ,2008?

P.S. I am currently waiting on an order for a logitech 1080p webcam, so no discrimination.

My webcam ran away. Sorry.
I would jump on the calling bullshit bandwagon, but i just loaned out my webcam last week so i can't really blame OP. Then again i'm typing this on an ipod with a camera so...

Parmesan cheese, can confirm from experience 
I've always put a ton of parm cheese in Top Ramen. I don't know why, but I love it. It fucks up the bowl and spoon and makes it nearly impossible to wash off as it clumps together...but it's so worth it. 
leftover white rice with butter, soy sauce and that gross fake Parmesan cheese stuff is SO GOOD, I used to also add leftover pork.
I love rice with fresh grated parmesean cheese and warmed up frozen peas.
Sooo you never tried risotto?  
Parmesan cheese: 10/10 (on other foods from experience)

Parmesan cheese with race: 10/10

This is one of my favorites.
Parmesan with anything as long as there is alot oft it: 11/10
I absolutely love parmesan and rice
That's my favorite way to eat rice. Especially if you put it on top of a fried egg,
Parmesan cheese on rice is one of my favorites.  Heat it up in the microwave,  melt the cheese, a little butter added, it's a ridiculous way to get fat.
Try doritos + parmesan cheese. Ugh lordie jesuss
This is basically lazy risotto.
What about parmesan cheese by itself?
Wait, didn't you want things that would be *disgusting* over rice, not tasty?  Ayo /u/CanadianDragon434, what kind of experience did you have that would make cheese on rice disgusting?  It's kind of always been a thing.
Maybe it wasn't cheese

dun dun dun
Try rissotto - so good with parm
I love a dash of race in my food. Changes the taste completely. 
>Parmesan cheese with race: 10/10

So the cheese isnt white? 

Edit: I know white is a race, I said this assuming the cheese is white, because you know, on occassion it is.
Well, Parmesan cheese *is* from Pennsylvania...
It has a little European blood 
It's a typo, it's supposed to say "white race."

Peanut Butter.

Edit: Ok all u Southeast Asian eaters, nuts are good, I'm referring to straight Jif, no other ingredients added. 
OP is a fraud, no way was this tasty.
In Australia, jif is a caustic, disinfecting cleaning liquid
Jif, here in Australia is a cleaner you use  in the bathroom.


Never had peanut sauce? I drown my rice in it before I eat it. And, since I'm late: [Here's your Noctowl](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/f/fa/164Noctowl.png/250px-164Noctowl.png)
I used to do peanut butter with rice in college a lot. Carbs, fat, and protein all in one. Very good for the body.
Wouldn't this taste like thai food if you diluted the peanut butter a little with water to make a peanut sauce, and maybe put a dash of hot sauce in for good measure?
Wat, I eat this every day.
you're absolutely right. I ran out of food on day 6 of a 5 day hike, all I had was this, put the peanut butter in the rice when it was almost done and went to town. It was rice but slimy, peanut butter but with soft lumps, an overcooked oatmeal consistency but no sweetness to cut the peanut taste.  I was running on a severe caloric deficit and couldn't even do it, had to hike out and didn't eat for another 9 hours.
Clearly never heard of peanut butter soup.
Peanut butter is actually used in many Asian dishes served with rice.
Where Im from Jif is an abrasive containing cleaning creme type product...

Spicy peanut butter chicken is pretty damn tasty on rice.
Peanut butter dowsn't seem too obscure. Peanut butter **sauce** is amazing with rice. 

Ingredients for sauce: couple spoon fulls of Peanut butter (duh), hot/warm water (just add more until sauce is smoothe, sweet soy sauce (1/4 of amount of peanut butter. Should result in segnificant darkening of color), half a lemon (juice), and a bit of salt

With tofu and soy sprouts and maybe some roasted onions, it makes a great meal.
You just said satay rice, by the way.  

I'll sometimes do up rice, stir in some peanut butter and maybe peas etc and go to town.

Filipino Food Called kare-kare. Peanut butter and oxtail soup...over rice

Edit : 10/10 delicious 
kare-kare is my shit.
Peanut butter: 10/10

Peanuter butter with rice: 10/10

Doesn't make too much of a difference, the peanut butter heavily masks the rice and just changes a bit of texture.


I was looking through the thread for this one. 

Peanut butter goes with everything as does rice so this sounds amazing I am going to try it. 

Good job OP. 
I really like peanut butter and jelly on rice. 
Was it just like crunchy peanut butter but different?
I've done chicken with a sauce that's pretty much a mix of soy sauce and peanut butter, and I'd say it makes it even better. Also, what kind of rice are you using? I feel like jasmine rice would go best with everything overall.
You put too much peanut butter.. Mix ½ a table with a bowl of rice and put that heaven in your mouth. 
How about Reese's peanut butter cups?
Apparently this a nice snack in Zimbabwe.
There is a Filipino dish that's basically peanut butter + chocolate + rice porridge. It's great with sugar, butter, a little milk mixed in with crackers. Champorado, I think it's called? Not sure how to spell it.
Question: what kind of rice are you using, here?  Mexican rice?  Japanese rice?  Chinese rice(is there even a difference?)?  Is there such a thing as Italian Rice?

Because most rice I've ever eaten doesn't have any kind of flavor "built in" to it.
Tapioca peanut butter.
Now add jelly for pb and j rice
My dad would eat peanut butter and jelly over rice all the time when my mom wasn't around to stop him. It was like a weird, crappy, fusion pb&j.

Rice and peanut butter tastes like rice with sateh-sauce. That ought to be a 10/10. ;)
I mean peanut sauce and rice is great so peanut butter shold be decent.
Microwave it so the peanut butter melts
Peanuter? Is that like regular peanut but more?
Kare kare is a filipino dish consisting of peanut butter sauce. Its eaten over rice and super good.

Mix peanut butter and sweet and sour mix like the kind you dip egg rolls in, heat up to just about a boil and simmer down. BAM, peanut sauce. Cook some chicken, top with peanut sauce throw over rice. Half Thai, it's what I do.

Abnormal dream, have you ever tried cold refrigerated rice? If not, I suggest it. That is how you make rice bad. Or you could ask my stepmother to cook you some rice. That woman could burn water.
Impossible, but it can be made bad with other things on it.
Burn the rice
You could burn the rice considerably. That would make it pretty bad.

I meant burnt as in *black*, not that amazingly delicious crispy rice you find at the bottom of your bibimbap bowl. Oh man, just thinking about that makes me want some. I really need to get a dolsot.
Ah, yes. Agreed on both counts.
Joke's on you. Burning is a chemical reaction, thus resulting in a completely different substance. Rice plus burnt rice. The unwavering tastiness of rice prevails against doubters such as thee.

Wait
So like you when you were delivered by UPS! ^^^That's ^^^where ^^^babies ^^^come ^^^from ^^^right?
No I was born in FedEx nice try though!
Try cardboard over rice... Or rice on cardboard.
But my mommy told me that's where liberals and commies come from!
I am weird, I used to eat the powdered drinks unmixed. 

It was a more of a love for the citric acid than anything else. 

I once got chemical burns on my tongue from eating pure citric acid. 


You are an idiot. 
We once had vodka with sherbet powder. I literally bled from my mouth after brushing my teeth that night.
At least you got that damage up though.
Jesus fuck
I use it to flavour vanilla protein drinks
You don't have a problem with the acid curdling the protein?
Nope.   I do srink it right away though.   I dont let it sit
I've gotten chemical burns from too many Nerds candies. When my tongue started peeling, I wanted to die. 
Losing your sense of taste is so weird. 

Especially when it is caused by citric acid. 

So hard to describe. 
It was over a decade ago and I still remember the patches of tongue surface sloughing off and how freaky it looked and felt. Never again, man. Just as well, Nerds are tooth killers. 
What the fuck 
That was about my reaction, too. I was terrified for a second, and then after a quick google, realized vitamin C is an acid, and that's why it happened. 
Can confirm. Straight citric acid locks my jaw and makes me drool. 
What about gay citric acid?
It is really cool stuff. 

I used it as a salt substitute while on a heavy sodium restricted diet. 

Worked pretty well. But sometimes I overdid it. 
Damn, wouldn't have guessed that. We used them to make bath fizzys with lavender and stuff. 
I never knew citric acid was used in bath stuff. 

What purpose did it serve in those products? 
As far as I can remember, it fizzed when mixed with baking soda and water. . I was just a medium to use to deliver the oils and other stuff, and looked cool. 

Ok, cool. 
that makes sense, it's like vinegar in baking soda + vinegar. Except it smells better to take a bath with citric acid than acetic acid.

It was me. I was phone. I'm sorry for lying to you for so long, I just couldn't live with myself knowing that I was phone. I had to keep it locked away inside where nobody would know. But I feel that now is the time to tell you. Now that I've grown old, it's time for me to pass on my duties of being phone to you. Be careful, my son.

Can we start a subreddit devoted to this?
Have you yet?
Yes sir, my fellow curious ricers started /r/withrice a few months ago, which I helped moderate for a while. Check it out.
Did you?
I did, but /r/withrice was created 3 hours later and is a lot better. I'm a mod on there as well, check it out!
/r/ateitonrice
/r/thankyouforyoursuggestion
Foodcombos
Back in the day, this would be its own website.
Just tell me when its done. 
I think maybe /r/thisoverthat would work out well.
/r/tryitwithrice

/r/withrice is a thriving little community now. Check it out! Was a moderator and co-founder of this venture until other commitments came up
How about instead a food combos subreddit, instead of just stuff over rice people can start different threads for different foods to combo. 
I'm down! Call it tastetests or something! 
/r/servewithrice
haha yeah make /r/thanksforthesuggestion
I have OP tagged as "Thanks For the Suggestion"
reddit.com/r/withrice

Edit: It's o-fishel
Go ahead and start it up! It sounds like a great idea!
Done.

Noped out of there when I saw insect on rice
/r/ReviewsOfAnything is already up and running.
This subreddit doesn't get it ; Shrimp is not weird on rice.
/r/withrice
So... the one I made was first? It's okay, I honestly like the other one better. More effort was put in, more explanation. Better all round. I'm happy just to combine but not sure how?
I think we could put links in the sidebar of each. I have more posts, more users, etc. If you are willing to admit defeat in brave, hearty battle, I will grant you full moderatorship and co-owner/creatorship of /r/withrice, just tell your /r/WeirdFoodsOnRice fans to come over to /r/withrice (simple is better)

I've gotten numerous pms about the intuitiveness of /r/withrice  as a name.

If you want to join forces, as separate but equal, just remember, I have css gurus on my side! First 24 hours are what counts for most new subs.

 PM me and we'll continue negotiations

Keen for that! I will absolutely say your subreddit is better. I'm not very good at names, can't code etc. etc. Keen to be a mod, and keen for the links in sidebar thing. Will pm.

croutons 
I love croutons and rice and ranch dressing. Fuck im so weird. 
Are you nuts? That would be awesome! Just soften them up with some gravy. 
Are you a chair?
Is this the Krusty Krab? 
No, this is Patrick.
No, this is Patrick.
Is this the Krusty Krab?

No I'm Patrick
Is this the krusty krab? 
Croutons, not cushions. 
Would you expect a *chair* to suddenly become a table?
No that is Patrick13.
No, this is Patrick.
Chair: not edible.

Chair with rice: what.
Just gotta try harder
How chairible.
Thank you for your suggestion
You, you make me laugh. Good job.
OP, thank you for making me giggle.

10/10 would read again
Chair with rice: squishy?
10/10
What about the croutons???
I somehow have a story relevant to chair with rice. Good old middle school lunch table shenanigans. I got in trouble for pulling a hilarious prank by putting rice on my friend's chair. For punishment at lunch time, they came up with this brilliant solution where troublesome students such as myself stand at the front of the cafeteria for an amount of days looking like a dick instead of sitting with your friends (you still eat, of course). I was assigned to do this for two weeks, did it for two days and the supervisors forgot. swag 

tl;dr chairs and rice is a dangerous combination
Not with that spirit, its not.
It would have an interesting crunch to it😂 but I was referring to the original commenter's username
>not edible

You aren't trying enough, OP:   5/10
I'm trying to eat my chair right now it is not working.
I love you, OP:  10/10
Of all your responses in this thread, this is my favorite. Thank you for doing this cross-over between an AskReddit and an AMA. Next time, you should do "spaghetti + [blank]". 
I actually may do that, but noodles are a bit more expensive, so I'm not as sure.
I think you could convince reddit to crowd fund the expenses in exchange for pictures of each dish along with your rating(s). It'd be like the new Epic Meal Time.
Not a bad idea... I think I'd contribute.
Chair with rice: a big fucking mess
Chewing gum.
R.I.P OP
Good point! Sadly, gum is not food and is thus disqualified on a technicality.
I would argue that's not a food.
Gum is not food. It's indigestible.
Gum isn't food.  You chew it and spit it back out.
Reminds me of Homer Simpson's idea for a snack food: nuts n' gum, a jar full of little pieces of gum mixed with nuts.
BUT... Is chewing gum a food? Food is meant to be ingested. Chewing gum is not. Therefore, I submit that while chewing gum is tasty, and it would be disgusting served over rice, it is not in fact a food and thus does not fulfill OP's criteria. 
Chewing gum isnt food. 
[deleted]
I know, I think I win so far! Haven't heard back on maggots, but depends on whether OP thinks maggots are a tasty food...
Nope, and where would I go upon getting maggots?
Leave the rice out for a couple weeks
One evening my six-year-old son walked into the kitchen and spit into the trash can.  He looked up and said, "Dad?  Clams and chewing gum don't go together."

Chewing gum and rice does sound pretty horrible, too.
Can chewing gum really be classified as food?
The FDA definition of food includes chewing gum.
So, where is penis on the food pyramid?
Anything can be classified as food; how much that will matter or mean to others, I have no idea. 
Ooh, pedantic but good point. I think OP eating it makes it qualify for these purposes.
So I can eat anything to make it a food?


Interesting.
So this is how you ended up attempting to eat a chair?
Minty chewing gum: 9/10

Minty chewing gum with rice: 4/10

Bubble gum: 8/10

Bubble gum with rice: 2/10

The rice gets stuck in the bubble gum pretty badly and makes it have an awkward taste and feeling.

Thank you for your suggestion.
Happy cake day. lol
if you use uncooked rice, it will be chewing gum with krispy inside .. mm so much better
Gross... I don't think I could have done that.
Well now i have to try this 
Is anyone else bothered by the fractions not being simplified?
OP I have a hard time believing you actually went through with it and ate and swallowed gun and rice in a combo. Not saying it isn't possible, just saying most people probably wouldn't do that. Can we have pics of these monstrosities? 
The worst part about swallowing gun and rice would be the shooting pains.
rice with Bubble gum : 10/10 
Finally, we found one that was *actually* disgusting!
I thought the title said "Over Ice" mint gum with ice is amazing.
Owww no!
I mean not ice that's hard to chew, but like thin ice. Idk how to explain it but it tastes/feels really good
Ugh, did you chew and swallow all that gum and rice? You might have a rough time tomorrow.
Nah, I didn't. 
Now they're both gonna be in your stomach for seven years. 
Swallowing gum is harmless.
I swallow gum all the time. Haven't noticed any ill effects.
He could be like that guy on TIFU who pooped out endless gum.  If somebody could find a link I'd be appreciative.
Nope, I spit. My mother would think I was a failure.

EDIT: Sorry, some edited my comment in class what a little shit.
/r/NoContext
EDIT: this comment, formerly funny, has to go because I just read farther down in the comments that OP is 14 years old. Let's take it easy on the kid.

ETA: My first gold! shiny! That really makes up for the f-you this comment already earned, which was depressing me. Perfect.
you're telling me this guy is 14 and he has access to all these kinds of foods without having to go to the store?
So you're willing to believe he's lying about his age, but not that he's telling stories about making all of these different kinds of foods in the space of a couple of hours?
Would people do that? Go on the internet and lie about the foods they eat?
In this case I would call it pretend rather than lie. But who knows.
I think it speaks about my love for eating large amounts of food if I find him lying about his age more probable. 
He said the store is next door. 
If you were 14, could you afford all of these suggestions?
Well, what else is he buying? He's 14.. He/she could be working odd jobs for the neighbors like raking leaves or something and he has some cash to throw around so why not? 
Looks like he'd need about fifty bucks. So yeah, maybe. 
What did it say?
Believe me, /r/teenagers doesn't take it easy. *Insert CoD teens fucking moms and whatnot*
You guys really underestimate teens.
14 is a pretty young teen. For me it's not so much about underestimating as that people shouldn't be saying sexually suggestive things to teens, especially young ones. 
As an experiment, try walking through the hallways of your local middle school filled with 11-13 year olds, or just walk through the crowd of them walking home. 
That doesn't mean I as an adult get to say sexual things to them!
But you undermine them by treating them as less than they really are by doing that. 
Ick.
*Shrugs*
Who gives a fuck it's the internet
@edit: are you fucking kidding me.
Reddit having mercy?! Welp, I'm outta here. 
I can guess what you said.
To be fair, he's probably just as mature as the rest of us. 
Someone spent 4 bucks to give you gold, put the joke back.
They gave me gold because I took the high road on the internet and took the joke down. Nice try.
What was the original comment?
Wouldn't that defeat my purpose? It was something inappropriate to say to a kid, nothing so hilarious that you should lose sleep over it or anything.
Oh, yeah. I'm a dumbass. Just something hurtful with little comedic value?
Some comedic value, but inappropriate content for his age, that's all.
You should just say what it was. He probably saw it anyway, and trying to protect kids on Reddit from Reddit is futile.
I've done the dirty work and reposted the comment. I agree with Cogitotoro, but I'm a different user, and my comment is obscure and non-upvoted, so I think it's okay for me to post.

> Mom encouraged you to swallow?

For the use of shiny have an upvote, keep flying my friend
dude 14 was the peak of my porn watching years. he can bear to hear a sex joke haha
Your use of shiny made my day!

What was your original comment?
It's not really too offensive without context. Here:

> Mom encouraged you to swallow?

Haha I think that's fine. He's 14, he probably enjoys that joke more than most adults would!
There's a joke in here...somewhere...

^^hnnnnnnng...
Really? I assumed he was an adult. 
I know, me too. I wouldn't let my kid on here at 14. He does seem like a precocious, intelligent kid, so it's not immediately obvious. And of course who knows, but he says he is, so I'm not taking any chances by saying something even mildly pornographic to him. Some of the things people have said in this thread alone! Hope he turns out okay. 

ETA: He breaks my heart saying people are hurting his feelings.
I feel like you're underestimating the intelligence of teenagers.
When I was 14 I was jacking off to some seriously depraved shit. 
oh wow, thanks for reminding me that kids that young COULD be here.  yikes.
At 14 I was starting my sophomore year in high school so from that perspective it doesn't seem so bad imo.
Oh my god his feelings are hurt?! I feel so bad for him now! It definitely gets tough if reddit finds out you're young. Everything I type seems like sarcasm now and I feel like a dick even though I'm trying to be nice. I should probably just quit.
I really don't think its a matter of letting your kid on here or not.  If your kid wanted to get on here, they could.  Trust me, I'm a kid (17 so almost an adult, but regardless still a kid) and my parents don't even know I can get on the internet, much less do they have any clue what I do on here, or really any clue about me at all.  This might be in part because I don't really show myself to them, but even if I did show them a bit more than I do I think they'd still be shocked and confused by many of the opinions I have and my general view on the world, as well as my interests and sense of humor.  

To them, my laptop is basically a gaming console.  But since I connected to the internet without the password one time when they weren't home (button on the back of the router), my laptop has complete access to just about anything I want, including everything my phone can do, which is quite useful since they make me put my phone away at 11.

Then again I've had a rather different life growing up than most, and I had to mature much faster than the accepted norm, basically running the household at about age 14, since my mother was mentally unstable.  It's a miracle she even managed to bring home enough money for us, and I'm thankful that she did, but she did literally nothing else.

TL;DR Kids are slick, and the smart ones will find a way to get whatever they want without you knowing, regardless of if you allow them to or not.
Wow.  This comment was an odd adventure.
I have a tenancy to get slightly too deep into things when I reply to random internet comments.  It's just me being a bit of a writer, I suppose.

I'll stop here before I go on a tangent about writing.
> Kids are slick, and the smart ones will find a way to get whatever they want without you knowing, regardless of if you allow them to or not.

Little do my kids know that I wrote the filtering software running on what appears to be a normal wireless router. :)
Oh man, those WPS buttons are hilariously insecure.
The encryption on the router is actually WPA2 which can't be cracked with any free tools I've been able to find, except by brute force if the password happens to be a real word, which as it turns out is not the case for this password.  Its secure enough to keep marauding neighbors off, but certainly nothing for keeping anyone in the house off, although the button IS in my parent's bedroom, so I have to wait for them to leave me alone one day after they change the password.

Either that or I just get on Mom's laptop for something "school" related, grab the password from the Windows network center, open a few school related sites so they show up in the history, and go about my business.

Either way, yeah.  In this day and age it's pretty much impossible to keep a tech-savvy kid off the internet.
So OP is 14 and his parents are letting him use all this food and rice up...?
My guess: OP is 14 and wasn't really eating any of this, just having fun telling stories as if he was. Anyway, safest to believe it when someone says they're underage, don't you think?
I think it's better to test them on it.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I like his mom
She always did. 
For everybody.
*sigh*...broken arms
love it! So dark
And I had nearly forgotten about this. Thanks
Now I really want to know what You said.
It's not really too offensive without context. Here:

> Mom encouraged you to swallow?

I was expecting a joke like that, but his edit just made it all that more intriguing.
>mom

>chewed and spit

Uh, later in the comments...

>broken arm

>sigh

Sigh.

I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE ALL THOSE DAMN 10/10 WITH RICE COMMENTS CAME FROM

How the hell did I miss this thread in the first place?
Make an appointment with your local optometrist.
Boo
Yes
Me, too.
ditto
same! Where the hell was I?
Right?
Uncooked rice. 
This is just the worst suggestion. I bit down wrong on a piece of uncooked rice once and it decided to slide up where my two front teeth meet right up into the inner gum. The only way to get it out was to make a lot of suction in my mouth until it made its way out. Just the worst. 
I don't consider uncooked rice to be tasty
I only eat uncooked rice paired with uncooked chicken and potatoes.  
Do you live... In Alaska?
Indeed I do
Uncooked rice is tasty?
[removed]
I love you OP please eat more food
Cool
you should probably either edit the OP with your Youtube Channel, or edit [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2np694/what_tasty_food_would_be_distusting_if_eaten_over/cmfkuej) comment
You're a horrible guest for serving a 5

Shit the fuck yes!

Dude, I fucking love you even though you're only 14
I'm pretty sure people go to prison for that
Not illegal for me, I'm 16
You're a genius. I'd marry someone like you, but like seven years older 
Just be patient and wait 7 years. Duh!
You'll be playing find the dentist once that uncooked rice fucks your teeth.
Hey OP, I just watched all your videos so far.  I found them pretty entertaining and look forward to more!  My one suggestion is to have a [mise en place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place) for your videos to eliminate dead time while messing with cereal boxes and jars and whatnot.  Just pre-measure your ingredients into whatever small containers you've got so you can dump them in instantly.

How much for the tm?
Ghost pepper salsa
um, that would be delicous.
Mrs Rienfros (spelling?) makes some of the best ghost pepper salsa I've tried. I litterally cry and have a runny nose from the peppers but I'll finish a quarter of the bottle in one sitting.
Ghost Pepper Salsa made by Mrs. Renfro's is actually delicious.  Very hot, but has a good taste too.  It's actually hard for me to put down despite how hot it is.
I've had this, and it would probably be amazing with rice, I wanna try that now.
Doesn't specify how much ghost pepper must be in the salsa. Mrs. Renfro skimps on that shit.
I disagree!  I think it is spicy as hell!  That being said, I have had a bite of a plain ghost pepper and it was the spiciest thing I've ever put in my mouth. So the salsa definitely isn't as hot as it could be, but it is still ridiculously hot.
I also saw that thread earlier today! 
My house loves ghost pepper salsa, we have a ghost pepper plant and make our own :)
That would be pretty good. Also add some refried beans, beef/peppers onions, wrap the whole thing up in some kind of flatbread... you got yourself a stew goin'!
That sounds really good actually. 
I love ghost pepper salsa. My local salsa guy makes it and the pain is exquisite and the salsa is delicious. 

Man wish I had some, it'd probably be great with rice
Actually I eat that most every day. If not ghost pepper sauce I use scorpion peppers. As someone who loves spicy food it's amazing.
That actually sounds really delicious. And I know where to get some good ghost pepper salsa...
I got this one, I've done this.

Ghost Pepper Salsa: 6/10 (I love the heat, but the flavor is kinda sub-par)
Ghost Pepper Salsa with Rice: 8/10

The rice reduces the heat and lets the flavor transfer around.  Also makes an awesome chip topping.  Would highly recommend.
I've done that and it tastes amazing. Super spicy, but also delicious 
It really is. Well, delicious anyways. I've gotten a bit desensitized to the heat.
Ghost pepper salsa on rice? That would work.
Nope! 
If it makes any difference Ghost Peppers aren't even the spiciest thing known to man anymore.
They were never the spiciest thing known to man. They were, at once point, the spiciest chilli pepper
What is the spiciest thing known to man?
Source?
The spicier peppers are not naturally formed but cultivated / selectively bred. In a way the ghost pepper is still the spiciest natural food known to man. Artificially we could then just say pure capsaicin then.
What is?
Carolina Reaper.
Does it make u kil?
Thanks DBZ!
It's still the spiciest natural pepper, as the Scorpion pepper is genetically modified.
I love how the people below have just repeated your joke more obviously and got gold and more upvotes than you.
[Carolina Reaper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale) is the current record holder.
Well that depends on the spiciest *thing* or the spiciest *pepper*.
The spiciest pepper I think is the scorpion stinger. And the spiciest thing is resinoferotoxin, which is right at 2 million scoville units which will damn near kill you it's so spicy. 
The Carolina Reaper has topped 2 million scovilles. 
What is
Carolina Reaper
Sounds scary
I just did this one since I had some Ghost Pepper salsa and fried rice in the fridge. 

Ghost Pepper Salsa: 10/10

With Rice: 8/10

Ate it over the rice cold, but it seems like it would be pretty good with the salsa heated up a bit.
I made the mistake of trying a slice of supreme pizza with sliced up Carolina Reaper pepper on it. Fuck the person who offered me that.
Well, I think pure capsaicin would be spicier. 
I happened to eat the hottest pepper in the world known today, the Carolina reaper. I only ate a quarter of the pepper but was crying tears of pain for about an hour 
They never were. They were the spiciest *Natural* pepper in the world
They are not natural, they are a hybridization.
Whats the spiciest *ever*
Carolina reaper
It's the scorpion pepper now, and let me tell you, that bitch is hot. It starts off about as hot as a habanero and steadily gets hotter and hotter. To me it seemed like it kept getting hotter for about 5 minutes before it stabilized to a crippling heat. I ate 5 pieces of white bread and drank 3 glasses of milk before it even thought about dying down. All in all though, 6/10 would do again. 
It also feels like someone is trying to drag your lips off your face with spiked pliers.
Good flavor though. The one by Dave's is good on everything. 
There's a mentally insane last that sells ghost pepper hot sauces at the county fair around here. All it has in it is chunks of ghost pepper, and pineapple juice. Excellent on pork, chicken, and peas. And it's really not hot at all. 
The scorpion pepper was actually topped by the [Carolina Reaper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Reaper) couple of years back according to the Guinness World Records.Haven't tried one yet, but I have eaten the scorpion pepper. Instant regret, haha.
Most everything I eat is covered in scorpion pepper sauces. They're not nearly hot enough for me anymore but I can't find any carolina reaper sauces that I like yet.
I actually liked the Scorpion.  Probably my favorite hot pepper.  Dry them out and then crush them over pizza.
I've eaten a few ghost peppers, and while they are extremely hot, they are NOTHING compared to the Carolina Reaper. I put a slice of the pepper in my mouth, and chewed it for a few seconds. It wasn't bad at all. Spicy, but not much worse than chewing on any other "hot" pepper. The instant I swallowed it though, my throat clinched shut. My face immediately went 100% numb from the nose down, and snot, spit, and tears drained out of their respective orifices nonstop for a good 10 minutes. I looked like Munch's *The Scream* because I was completely unable to control my facial muscles enough to close my mouth. I couldn't speak intelligibly because my tongue was entirely limp. After several minutes of this, I returned to normal (though my mouth was still on fire) and went about my night. At like 4 am, I woke up with an intense stomach ache, and ralphed that fiery fucker into the toilet, getting to enjoy the burn a second time.

10/10 for novelty, will never do again
Yeah reapers really do attack the throat.
Oh god, it builds so much. At first it's bad, but give it time and you feel like your whole face is a volcano.  I drank so much Chocolate milk after that a puked.  Was not fun the other way up either.  All I had was a sliver.
Thank you so much for this wonderful review of the Carolina Reaper. I got to fully appreciate the experience of eating one and won't ever be silly enough now to try it myself.
> Reaper

Reaper sucks so very much. Have tried it twice, the first time as curiosity, the second as a dare: slept on the pot the second time around, just in case.  

Reapers are also very hard to import into many, many countries. Customs in India, for example, pretty much detained me after their guy started hacking his lung out after having a bite! 
Wait, so the guy in India just casually took a bite from your food as you were passing through customs? 
[deleted]
I... What? 
Oops. Wrong guy
Dare I ask what happened the *first* time if you slept on the pot the second time?!
The prompt disposal of a couple of clothes. I literally became a browncoat that night. 
"Reaper." "Browncoat." I see what you did there.
Lava isn't the hottest thing known to man, but are you going near lava? Didn't think so. 
Yvonne Strahovski is the hottest thing known to man, and fuck yes I would go near her.
Lava over rice would be delicious, if only I could get near it!
You just need a couch with wheels. Couches are immune to lava.
American Sushi: A rolling rice couch served on a bed of imaginary lava
If I had a flame resistance II potion, why not?
I took a helicopter to a volcano with lava
Happy cakeday!
If I had one of those suits volcanologists wear, then hell yeah I would.
That's a thing???
Those are designed more so to avoid asphyxiation and burns by proximity (have you ever been near an open fire and felt the heat washing over you, that shit can hurt), especially since lava is nothing but nasty shit.  
Or the kind Vulcanoligist wear. 

Aren't they just geologists? 
>volcanologists 

Pronounced that in my head as "Vulcanologists," was confused.
I'd rather stay home. We have WiFi there
And one of those cast-iron smelting cup-on-a-stick deals that you can dip and spin molten earth blood everywhere
Those suits only protect you for like 8 min if you're fully engulfed in lava. 
*Turns to camera*

"And remember, when it contacts the suit, please stop, drop and OH FUCKKKKKKKKKKKkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk".............................................................................'shhhhhhhhhhhhhhszzcht'

[exuent]


7 minutes, 59 seconds of pure amazing though. 
A lot longer then if you weren't 
More like 1/8 a second.
Wait, did they actually throw one in a pit of lava? That's pretty cool. I wonder if there is a video of it. 
Woah, that's really cool actually!
Actually it would be quite hot.
But it would let you live long and prosper.
That's 8 minutes longer than I'd expected.

Though, just what the fuck do you do after you climb out? You're covered in lava!
This is actually a pretty horribly almost funny problem. Because think of you jumped in water it could possibly fully coat you in rock and you could maybe even be crushed.

I bet it's probably dance like an idiot, do jumping jacks and the like. To fling it off.
No, not even close.  
You wouldn't last 8 seconds if you fell into lava wearing an aluminized suit. It only reflects radiant heat. Heat from direct contact, especially liquid sticky 3000 degree death lava, is going to ruin your day even if it's just a splash.
You're the kid that when his mom asked if "would you jump off a bridge if your friends were doing it" would say "yes, if I had a parachute" 
I was that kid too. 
http://xkcd.com/1170/
I don't think those things would help you if you fell in or tried to pick up or drink lava you know. 
"If it makes any difference, mountain lions aren't the deadliest thing to humans." I still sure as hell ain't going near that shit

Quite late to the party my friend
In terms of animals, its actually the mosquito.
So conflicted. Want to upvote, but 1337 karma. 
Sound point, but spiciness usually doesn't have permanent consequences
Take a dried ghost chili and put it on a subway sandwich. It almost completely gets rid of the heat,just adds the flavor and a little spice.
You are a GIANT LIAR! 
I swear dude.
Aren't humans the most deadly animal to humans? 
Nope. Mosquitos.
Well not just mosquitos, but malaria, but only the reaction the body has to malaria. So humans kill humans... I didn't get an a in biographology.
"Why won't you let me shoot you? It's just a 9 mm, I could've used my shotgun!"
It's more like, "It's just an atomic bomb! I could have used a hydrogen bomb!"
There is more than one type of atomic bomb and hydrogen bombs are one of them. 
True, but colloquially, "atomic (or atom) bomb" more commonly refers to fission-type detonations, rather than the fusion-based hydrogen (or thermonuclear) type.
As an atomic bomb specialist I can confirm
You must be the only Amish atomic bomb specialist on the planet...

You're much better than most AMA posters.
Hey! You cannot just quit now.
massive respect. you're op of the year in my eyes.
One of the best OP threads since I've been here.  Well done.
No, *you're* insane.
What if... You put rice... On. RICE?!
JESUS CHRIST NO ITS TOO MUCH
But seriously though I love you all.
How much karma ~~food~~ did this thread net you?

I'm glad you exist internet person (:
Bit late to the party, how much rice did you cook?
Are you kidding me? That's almost an instant reply while you are on the frontpage getting flooded.

I'm not sure I have ever seen so much potential in a person of your age.

By the way, would you know a quick and easy way to count the number replies OP made in his thread? I'm suddenly very curious.
[Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) 
Funnily enough my reddit is enhanced. Simply never noticed that such a feature existed. Still have no idea where to check it, so I just used search to count once-per-comment and in-every-comment occurrences. 
I'm trying to make sure that almost everyone gets a reply. And dear lordie I have way too many replies to even count.
Let's make that one more open to answer :>
Well, currently it is 157, and a lot of them involved eating in between comments. Very impressive indeed.

Would it possible to somehow help you achieve your goals? Kickstarter to a trust fund for your future studies in MIT or something?

I would very much like to see what a person like you could achieve with a good education and no burden of debt slowing you down.
I don't want any sort of money, I just want a smile on everyones faces!
I can relate to that.

However should you find yourself in a situation where you do not want money, but seriously need it, just keep in mind that there are people who would like to see you succeed and would gladly help you out as much as they reasonably can.

I do wonder what your future will be. Though no doubts it is something to look forward to :)
I may consider livestreaming one day and eat random foods and get some tips :)

And thanks for the positive messages this is definately my favorite comment of the day!
You may not want money now.  But you will some day, amigo lol.
Thank you, really.

I was having a bit of rough time, so your words and actions definitely helped lift my spirits :)

Glad to see that subreddit created, should be a fun fresh breeze in my currently little bit stagnant frontpage.

See you around :)
Four whole months of gold.
Your gold expires soon
Gold?
Ugh I'm so happy have a great night everyone don't die in your sleep
I wonder how many people died in their sleep that night, and how many people attributed this comment to their loved one's death.
Thanks 
OP, I love you. 
I died
I did.
You just gold train'd yourself. 
Holy crap, thats like 27k commemt karma in a row. Teach me master.
Guys I think OP has gone crazy, he keeps talking to himself
well obviously im not going to die of cancer after a night's worth of eating rice-filled pancakes <:I
When an OP spanks the front page.
Man you are seriously like the best 14 year old ever I wish I was this cool/funny at 14.
Don't tell me what to do!

Also interrupted your self-karma train.

Someone give me gold.
Oops, I'm too poor for gold.

I got banned from /r/redditgetsdrawn yesterday for a dick eating-related joke. I teased my friend about her drawing, she asked if I'd tried eating dick, I said no, and asked if she could help me since she seemed to know her way around one. 

Boom, first subreddit ban ever :(
/r/redditgetsdrawn has too many rules to be internet.
Like, it wasn't even a rule. The only related rule was to be courteous, but making a joke to a friend isn't really *dis*courteous? The mod was just a bitch. 
I mean you did [lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4WoVMWn154) to her, but that's still funny as fuck!
This is the best thread
Came here to say this. Thanks OP. 
No, you're the best thread!

Edit : Holy shit you are a 14 y/o! Represent!
I don't care that he is a young wippersnapper.

Sir, you are the funniest fucker that ever fucked the funny fucker.

... Wait.
I fucked the funny fucker?

Fuck.
OP this may sound very forward and I've only known you for maybe 10 minutes but

I've never had a better OP :')
y-you too
Enjoy the show.

W-wait! D-did I say that aloud? B-baka!

OP's 14, so technically he would be Kouhai. At least if you are older than OP.
Soggy bread
So you genuinely like soggy bread ?
Cheating! it was supposed to be something delicious!
I threw up in my mouth a bit. 
'Sup not Gavin
How is that a tasty food by itself?
Shh, don't tell OP 
Oooooh Gavvy Wavvy
Don't tell Gavin
Wot... If... Your rice... Didn't know it was on bread?
Gavin Free would already be gagging by reading this haha
Instantly thought this as well fellow achievement hunter fan :)
Tagged in RES as "thinks soggy bread is tasty".
NOW I FINALLY FUCKING KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE TAGGING OTHER PEOPLE AS SHIT. GODDAMN.
I have observed that Westerners love putting bread in stew/soup, so they must like soggy bread a lot...  
You know what? Mine, too.
Do you even soup mofo?!
I love soggy bread! Not even kidding. I dip it in milk. 
Now you'll downvote him without remembering why.

"He likes soggy bread? Fuck that guy! Downvote!"
AKA opposite Gavin Free 
Yay my first RES tagging!

Edit: Spelling is hard
at least you're not the guy who got tagged as "knows way too much about whale cum"
Your first RES tagging that you're aware of. 
And not your last. (same tag)
If it's soggy from gravy then yes, yes it is. Open faced turkey sandwiches for days
Confirmed not Gavin Free. 
We all know Gavin wouldnt even be able to stand even the sight of it haha
Soggy bread: 1/10

Soggy bread rice sammich: 4/10

I guess it helped a bit.

Thank you for your suggestion.
First funny bone tickle of the day, via Reddit.
tagged as: He likes soggy break better when it is accompanied by rice.

thats going to be fun to stumble upon one day.
By soggy bread, try a roll dipped in gravy until it's soggy and then with rice. Much higher.
This is the first one that made me legit laugh out loud. My cat looked at me funny. 
How do you eat wet bread without throwing up??
I like this one. Definitely the most begrudging "thank you." In your whole post.
holy shit im crying from how funny this is now 
>definitely the moist.

Ah yes, much better.
Plot twist: this is Gavin Free writing this 
It's kind of a sad and angry way of saying thanks for your useless crap.

Yeah, this thread is producing genuine laughs, with actual sound, every time I scroll down some more. I think I'll be here a while....
Everyone loves this OP, but reddit loves bashing teens. Can we now all see that teens really aren't that bad, with OP being only 14?
Unsubscribe from the bigger/default subreddits and you'll see a lot less vitriol towards teenagers. 

I imagine the chief complaints regarding teens is that many behave or speak as though they are worldly or well-versed on subjects they aren't. At 25, I can tell you that I was real stupid as a teenager, but at the time I thought I was hot shit. 
Haha I like you
Nothing. Rice is fucking bomb yo.
Yes it is
Bomb: 10/10Bomb over rice: 2/10Odd texture, but my taste buds really exploded.
True. But isn't spaghetti better?
Depends on whose spaghetti it is.

Everyone spaghetti's deep down inside.
I know I'm 🍝 on the inside
SPAGHETTI IS MY MOST FAVORITE THING IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE......plz notice me OP
OP has noticed you. OP approves.
Thanks bby <3
Depends on what kind of sauce is in it.

Spaghetti sauce
Ew.
LOL, God I love reddit.
What's you spaghetti policy here?
pesto.
How about rice sauce?
I consider hoisin or joy sauce to be rice sauce
Thank you for your suggestion.

Thank you for your suggestion.
Mom's rice spaghetti.
OP, I love you. You're great.
Ayo... I flip on the fixture / to make my rice-spaghetti mixture /  
And for that I can vouch / I keep this food in a pouch /

I'M SHAAADYYYYY!
On my sweater already
There's vomit on his rice sweater already
Eminem is my favorite artist too.
Very late but you should give Filipino spaghetti a try, it's really good and easy to make. 
You may think I'm crazy (my college roommates did) but put pasta sauce (marinara, alfredo, etc) on rice. It tastes just like noodles and sauce. Plus with an electric rice cooker, it's so much easier to make than noodles. Don't have to keep an eye on the pot, etc.
There's vomit on my sweater already just imagining that nastiness.

The stuff Popeye's eating to get the muscles.  

edit: Apparently he was eating Spinach all along.
Spinach and tomatoes cooked with rice is amazing.
Dude. Spinach with rice is actually good.Dont know why you would think otherwise.
I eat spinach, rice, and chicken all the time. its amazing. I'll also use mild buffalo wing sauce in it as well, or horseradish sauces.
Sunny side up eggs
Who the hell doesn't know that's spinach?
Weird, I'm eating that right now as I read this...

Spinach has more protein per calorie than steak does.

Spinach? 
You can't tell me Popeye gets buff from just spinach. That fucker must be on something. 
Cocaine. I bet it was cocaine. 
The idea that spinach is so high in nutrients is an old misconception. It's actually just kinda average really.
Originally the FDA over stated the health benefits of spinach by typo which was quite large.  So someone made into a cartoon 
It's spinach with rice
olive oil?
Fun fact, Popeye was originally supposed to chew tobacco, before they changed it to spinach.
Its because back in the day scientists put a decimal in the wrong place and reported the amount of Iron in Spinach to be a lot higher then it actually was.
Popeye has most likely injected synthol in his forearms, considering the rest of his body looks like he doesn't even lift.

Tastes kind of like a sushi wrap except no sushi.
Here's a fun fact, "sushi" actually refers to rice with sugar added which makes it sticky. That's how it holds its place on seaweed sheets
So it tastes like a wrap
Creamed Spinach with rice used to be one of my favorite combo's.
I think this is the only one where it tasted better over rice
My family does this a lot.
Useless to respond now, but it's actually an Arabic dish (the spinach with rice and an egg.) Also, someone at my dad's work made just rice with spinach, so it's a thing, if it's cooked.
Spinach with rice is one of my staple foods. It's awesome.
Rice and spinach is an actual plate in lebanon we add stuff to it and it tastes great :)
Actually boiled spinach with rice is a simple greek food ;) adding some lemon juice to it would make it amazing.
One of the main dishes my mother makes is rice, spinach, and ground beef. It treated pure awesome
Nice man! I just wanted you to have something nice after all the gross stuff you were eating.
Spinach with rice is actually a Lebanese dish that we like to make with chopped meat on top. It's really delicious and I like it better than plain rice.
My mom fries up spinach with pieces of beef and we eat it over rice. Sooooo good!
Indian recipe for Spinach Rice http://www.spiceupthecurry.com/palak-rice-recipe/
if you make spinach right, its delicious and tastes even better with rice
If anyone's interested - I'm Greek and we have a dish called Spanakorizo - which pretty much translates to 'spinach rice'.

[Here's a recipe for it](http://www.food.com/recipe/spanakorizo-a-greek-spinach-risotto-59468)

A bit off topic, if you want something even tastier with spinach (no rice) and meat, try [Lamb Fricassee](http://mamastaverna.com/lamb-fricassee-arnaki-frikase/).

Edit: These aren't the recipe's I use, but I can post them if anyone's interested.
Of course we want the real recipes for delicious Greek food! 
I should have known!  Here you go - these are the recipes I use:

Spanakorizo  

Serves: 6  
Cooking time: 20-25 minutes

1 kg (2 lb) spinach or silverbeet  
1 cup chopped spring onions  
1 leek, chopped (optional - I don't normally add this)  
1/2 cup olive oil  
1.5 cups short grain rice  
2 tablespoons lemon juice  
1 tablespoon chopped parsley or dill  
3 cups water  
salt and pepper  

1 Wash spinach or silverbeet very well

2 Remove stems, drain leaves well and tear into pieces. If using silverbeet, chop the stems finely, parboil for 5 minutes in salted water and drain.

3 In a deep pan gently fry onion and leek (if used) in oil until soft.

4 Stir in rice and cook 5 minutes.

5 Add remaining ingredients and parboiled silverbeet stems (if used).

6 Bring to the boil and add spinach or silverbeet.

7 Stir well, cover and cook gently for 15 minutes.

8 Remove from heat, leave tightly covered and allow to stand for 5 minutes before serving.

9 Serve hot as an accompaniment to main meals, particularly grilled meats and fish.

An improvement!  Finally, a combination with use!
Did you cook the spinach? Sounds good if you did. We cook ours with spicy shrimp paste bagoong. It's A+
What is that stuff and where can I find it? 
The fucks a bagoong 
my lola makes this dish a lot. It's actually one of my favorite food of all time
what the fuck is an A+? you mean 10/10?
Bagoong is a fun word 10/10
A pinoy! That's the stuff. Really good in a broth too! 
These people don't know our Filipino flavors man!
Pinoy boy detected!
I don't know what the hell a bagoong is, but it sounds hella fun. I want ten.
It's awesome if you stew some pork and add in bagoong, it's shrimp paste btw.
Spicy, fermented shrimp paste. It's delicious.
Look it up. It sounds crazy but is surprisingly delicious if paired with something like mango slices. 

Also, lots of Pinoys in this thread lol. 
> spicy shrimp paste

It's purple and my family eats it but I absolutely hate that shit. It tastes how it sounds by the way and they eat it with mangos WTF? You don't get this innocent delicious sweet pure fruit and then all of a sudden rape it with shrimp paste.
Paste sounds like something you put on a butt rash, not in your mouth. 
It's like a sauce, butt thicker.
Highly underrated comment. I chortled loud enough to scare my cat.

Also that guy is clearly not Asian. We cook with so many pastes.
Say hi to the cat for me!
Uh.....shrimp paste isn't supposed to be purple and we eat it with those green sour mangos....
The larger, harder sour mangoes and bagoong go soooooo good together.  And the stuff I usually get is purple.  :D

I'm not a big fan of the brown stuff.
I eat the brown stuff exclusively. With mangoes or boiled vegetables.
There are three different kinds according to google images, red, purple, and brown.
TIL.
Mabuhay!

Sweet bread fried in sheep blood
Sub of /r/CoDCompetitive judging by your name?
I lost a wager on /r/codcompetitive so that's why name is this. I'm not expecting Optic to place first, which is what the wager was. I was using this account to get some karma so that I wouldn't be without any karma on it. It's funny how in one day I made more karma than I made in 2 years on my old account.
I don't see OG getting first with how bad they've been playing. I don't see much strategy in HP and it sounds like Crim only rushes in SND. They're going up against Justus in a few, who looked pretty good last night. 

Edit: Forgot to a word
Seriously keep it real, not everyone has sweet bread at their house. God, be realistic.
I don't think it's possible to fry something in blood...wouldn't that be boiling?
> ."

This is also tradition.
He said disgusting food over rice...
Would be pretty good actually.
How do you fry something in blood? wouldn't it cook the blood?
Going out on a limb here, are you welsh?
Welp... Don't have any of that in my local store.
Must've ran out of sweet bread
Try a supermarket with a deli counter, if you live near one. They might sell you it, or at least cow/pig blood
You can get it at the cemetery at midnight during a full moon.... or so I've heard. 
Most butchers have sheep's blood available for purchase.  I saw it when I went there to get sheep hearts for dissection in school.
Blood + rice? There is a special sausage found in Spain (and some latin american countries) called ["Morcilla"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sausage) that is made with blood and rice. Absolutely delicious.
In Poland we have something called [kaszanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaszanka), and I thank God (even though I do not actually believe in him) almost every day, that no-one told me it's made with blood when I was young. It's like the best thing, ever.
We have it in the UK too it's Black Pudding (essentially)
In Poland we call it Kaszanka. It's blood, rice and meat. Shit's tasty.
Dinuguan in the Philippines. (Wow, it's like we're the Latin Americans of Asia.)
I just use Sriracha, it's basically my blood now anyway with slightly less cayenne.
Can confirm.
Korean soondae is basically blood + rice sausage which I steamed. 4/10 would not recommend.
We make boudin down in Louisiana. It's just various food items ground up and shoved into a sausage casing. Shit is delicious. 
Yup, this is true. My girlfriend is West Indian and her family makes it. Except I think they call it black sausage (please no innuendos...). It's pretty dam good. 
we also have this in the highland provinces of the philippines. made like blood sausages, the local pinuneg is very very tasty. nomnomz
That's what I noticed fron the wikipedia article. Apparently it is very popular in a lot more countries than I thought.

It makes sense that the Phillipines has it too since they had Spanish influence. That's awesome actually.
does morcilla have any spices? pinuneg is jist plain rice pig's blood wrapped in pig intestines. very scrumptious. 
yep, morcilla in argentina is usually spiced. There's even one with cinnamon (really good actually!)

I'm not sure but I think it does. It's not supposed to be hot, if that's what you're asking.
They have an absolute ton of Spanish and Spanish-inflenced dishes in the Philippines, it's really quite peculiar for an Asian country. Empanada, lechón, chorizo, callos, churros. Not that surprising though when you consider it was actually one of  Spain's longest held colonies, they lost almost all their American ones at the start of the 19th century but held on to the Philippines until the end of it. 

Hot chocolate is also Spanish/Mexican in style and very popular, one of the best places in the world I have been  for it IMO. The Philippines was the first place in the world outside the Americas to get chocolate. For most of the colonial period, hundreds of years, the Philippines was governed not from Madrid but from Mexico City, which is where they brought it from. 
Wow, that's mind blowing. I'm mexican and I've always been interested in the Phillipines. We share a lot of history.
Yes they only started governing it from Madrid due to Mexican independence. It's a really fascinating place, a really strange mash up of Asia, Spain and American influence. They are Catholic like NO other country I've ever been to (and I'm from a Catholic country, and I've been to the Vatican), they are really hard core about the Catholicism, they all have Spanish names and roads and place-names also tend to be Spanish but English is the lingua franca from the American period (1898-WW2).

They have old converted US army jeeps for transport and a lot of other American habits like fast food chains all over the place, lots of guns (I've never seen so many guns in the street, the guy opening the door for you in Starbucks will very likely have a pump action shotgun, as will the tourist guides) and by Asian standards lots of crime and violence (it's probably the dodgiest Asian country I've ever been to, but I still really liked it). There are also guards with metal detectors at the door of any large store, but that is I believe more about the Muslim insurgency in the south than anything else. 
Consider moving then.
Optic fan boy! 
I lost a wager over at /r/codcompetitive. Optic won't place 1st and 2nd at Columbus so I'm getting sweet sweet karma on the new account.
Always fun to see fellow comp followers on different subs. Can optic really not place 1st or 2nd after the tK match? I'm not able to watch it. 
They can, but after seeing Loony drop 50 on LAN, I'm not to sure about there chances. So I'm getting karma on this account in preparation for there defeat!
Yeah and I heard Parasite dropped 60 which is crazy. It'll be an interesting day two for sure. 
AW is gonna be a great game to watch. Seriously, the first LAN having an AR drop 60 is insane.
I'm coming to your house ASAP.
Im sure we have some of that here in Wales... And If not, the neighbour has plenty of them... He wouldn't miss one sheep would he?

As someone who lives in Sydney it saddens me that there is no street named Wallaby Way (or indeed Wallaby anything, which is weird because we definitely have a lot of wallabies).
Are there drop bears?
Not in the city, you only get them in the bush.
For future reference, "P. Sherman" was the name of the dentist. The address was just 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

Enjoy it for now until they start complaining that God didn't intend to create rice and as an unintended consequence, it must be removed.

I vow that I shall deliver in place of OP. I have to wait for shipping though. Remind me in a week.
>Do it now.

Its ready to eat isn't it?
Some MRES come with rice.

And most aren't even that bad.
I had a tuna salad one a few weeks back. I hate fish. It it wasn't bad on crackers.
What the hell's MRE
Meal ready to eat.

Military version of luncables

But are MRE's even good in the first place?
Yes, the egg omelette one
Depends on the army. Either the French or Italians or both apparently have some of the best convenience foods known to man in theirs. And, like, espresso shots.
5/10
Edit: well, some mre have things like m&ms and skittles some times, or pouches of Apple sauce, those are pretty good
The MRE jalapeños cheese is something I would kill over.
I second this. My god I miss it. 
Marinara and meatballs is delicious.  Stay away from the breakfast foods.  The new maple sausage is just as bad as the old veggie omelet.
Oh Good God, the veggie omelette...*hurls, *dies of dysentery
Ate a few MRE's during Sandy, actually pretty tasty. 
Am enlisted, can confirm: MREs are not as bad as they're chalked up to be.
Except the veggie omelette
I'm pretty sure whoever commissioned that flavor said 'imagine Satan's asshole, then make something that tastes worse'... and then, years of sorcery and black magic paid off, the unholy pact creating something so revolting on such a fundamental level no human could palate it. Downrange, troops would stake bets in increasingly ludicrous competition for the chance not to consume this monstrosity. Mothers wept, the skies grew dark, until one day pot roast was added to the mre lineup, and balance was again restored to the universe.
I can confirm that the British 24hr ration pack also has a vegetable omelette. It must be a conspiracy.

Do you have mystery fish, too?
Seems like rice would be a vast improvement.
If for no other reason than desperately needed fiber. 
I've heard that about MREs.
It makes sense, they wouldnt want you to have to crap very often would they?
Actually, that does make sense.
Fried rice MRE sucks shit unless you add a chilli main
Jalapeño Cheese is MRE gold. 
Tobasco sauce 
I'd rather get the fried rice than the cornbread stuffing, though. 
Chicken pesto pasta or chicken fajitas is my favourite lol
There's a new one: taco pasta... I'm kind of afraid to try it.
Please lord, anything but the tomato chicken soup
Do you even vegi omelette?
pft veggie bring back a decade and get them tasty cheese omelets. is that fish? or egg? or wait wtf was that? *thows up*. cheese omelets for life
*hurl*
I do feel like rice goes with nearly everything... umm, maybe strawberry jam?

OP, be careful that you don't get sick!
Or, OP, get sick and then keep eating. 

I look forward to your post about your brush with bulimia.

Had I money and family that wouldn't immediately think I'm nuts, I'd do the alcohol versions for you. It honestly sounds really fun to mix foods (and drinks, in this situation) and see how they turn out
I really don't believe that, you know too much about the internet oO
That's okay OP, you are the coolest 14 year old I've seen on reddit.(Also you may be the only one but can't confirm)
racist
Use high quality grape juice, same thing except it hasn't been sitting in a barrel in some random cellar for a few years.

Or just put the grape juice in your garage for 4 years and drink it then.
If you have any at home the alcohol comes out through the cooking process just ask your mom or dad for help.

Source: Cooking classes and just helping in the kitchen with my Mom since I was twelve.

P.S. Mashed potatoes and rice
Actually the alcohol doesn't come out during cooking.
Source: Good Eats
Oh yeah baking is when it boils out.
The large majority of the alcohol will boil off, but in the end, you're almost always going to have some left. You're pretty unlikely to get intoxicated off of most cooking alcohols, but you'll definitely be consuming alcohol.
YOUR COOKING CLASSES AIN'T SHIT. THIS IS THE INTERNET.
I can't believe you're 14. You're the coolest 14 year old I've ever seen period. Question: how much money did you spend doing this thread?

Nothing, rice goes with everything. 
Try flourless chocolate cake and hoisin sauce over rice. Try not t puke at the table 
Flourless chocolate cake with hoisin doesn't sound good alone, either.
Rice is everything. Rice goes with rice.
It trusts  everything anyway, why can't *other* foods!?
*tusts

FTFY
Rice is flavorless and is pretty much just a texture so I mean it makes any food have a different texture which is the main change.
While i agree with you on about the texture, I dont exactly agree that it is flavorless. I suppose its not so much flavour as it is essence. That jasmine smell gets my appetite going everytime. 

Also, rice doesnt have to be PLAIN. Learn to make a pilaf and EAT MORE RICE.
I think rice has a flavor, but that flavor is "plain."
Ooops.
No big deal. Just a different opinion. As I wrote my response, I thought, "What if plain flavor is just what we say to flavorless foods so we don't hurt their feelings?"

Anyway, I've been reading more of this awesome, awesome thread. You have made greatness. And your sense of humor is astute.
Filipino here, can confirm.
Its spelled with a P, you sit on a throne of lies!
>Its spelled with a P, you sit on a throne of lies!

No it's F. Filipino is the noun that refers to the Philippine national language and to the Philippine people (Filipinos)

*But can be also spelled with P* because "Pilipino" is acceptable in our (filipino) language, most of us will still say Pilipino when referring to a Filipino person while speaking in Filipino/Tagalog.

For example: "Ako ay Pilipino." ("I am Filipino.")
I knew that I wouldn't have to scroll far to find a Filipino. My Filipino cow-orker eats rice with everything, and has even left a nice restaurant because they didn't have rice. 
Half Filipino. Can also confirm. 
Same. Tried to cut carbs so I stopped eating rice. Family has basically disowned me.
I'm also disowning you. You bring dishonor to our race. 
Fine. You people are loud anyway! CHOCOLATE MEAT DOESN'T EVEN TASTE LIKE CHOCOLATE I CAN'T EVEN
Goob... I know you. 
I thought you guys are all about the pancit and adobo.

You people are awesome. I'm sitting on a ship with lots of Filipinos trying to  finish my beer and go to sleep but they offer me another before I'm done so I'm stuck.

OP here, rice is good.
Hell we have chocolate pudding and rice
champorado! 

I like using arborio rice, glutinous rice and barley.

I will also add some cinnamon and a mashed banana to it. Sounds weird but trust me its delicious. Also, topped with evaporated milk and those tiny dried fish.

I miss my lolo and lola :(

OP! Try this as a breakfast. Melt a bunch of sugar and butter in hot rice, then as a little milk to make it like cereal. Soooo good.
This is more or less what's referred to as rice pudding, it's like oatmeal but using a different grain. Put some raisins in there too.
Nah man. Rice pudding is way different. It's got eggs and other ingredients and is much thicker and resembles pudding.
It varies from country to country. In places where they eat a lot of rice (e.g. Indonesia), their version of it tends to contain less extra ingredients.
have a friend whose idea of a snack is a scoop of steaming hot rice with a slice of cheese on top. wait of cheese to melt then enjoy.

Hey not bad... This is actually pretty decent.
You seem to have a very strong preference towards carbohydrate heavy foods.
/r/keto fainted in unison at the thought of some of these suggestions.
Damn, this thread reminded me about arroz con leche. Haven't had that shit in a while.
Omg yum
That's spanish for "something with sugar" right?
Rice milk; it's a custard-like pudding. In America we also have horchata, a kind of rice milk beverage.
Sugar is azúcar in Spanish.
you're thinking azucar
Close enough, last time I took spanish was high school 
Its actually "rice with milk"
Rice with milk.
You should not visit a spanish country before you learn actual spanish.
Actually, that's the fastest way to learn.
Your saying my 8th grade spanish class doesn't make me fluent in Spanish?!?
You're saying that my 9th, 10th, and 11th grade Spanish classes don't qualify me to disqualify you from setting foot in a Spanish-speaking country for your own good?

Foreign languages are for all intense and porpoises codes. If you've never learned it then words are difficult. 
Whoah. This just made learning a language so much more achievable.
Don't they teach it from middle school to highschool?
A lot of places don't offer it in middle school since it's not required. It's cheaper that way.

Rice with milk i believe
yes
Sí

FTFY
Just had some yesterday for that sweet sweet thanksgiving dinner
That shit is the bomb! When my mom makes it she puts cinnamon sticks and raisins. SOOO GOOD
Rice pudding. 
Hint: Never googled for arroz con leche recipes. Ask your resident cooking family member (you know you have one) for their recipe.

While similar looking, rice pudding is NOT arroz con leche, and it doesn't taste at all like it, and neither milk rice nor rice milk even approach what arroz con leche is.

And yes, there are a ton of recipes for "rice with milk" and all of them mention "this is arroz con leche, a spanish/mexican/whatever dish", but none of them taste the same. Seriously, ask any family member who cooks.
arroz con leche? is this rice porrige with milk? in the Philippines we have arroz caldo which is a congee made with chicken broth ginger onion leaves and yes chicken and chicken innards. 
Yesss. We called it sweet rice! My grandma used to make it for me when I was little. I loved it way too much. 
haha my first rice experience was with sugar and milk...mmmmm im making that for an after work snack today!
Holy shit, this entire thread is amazing.

10/10, OP. You get gold.
9/10 with rice.
I'm still waiting for op to try rice with holy shit.
Gold 2/10

too pointy.

Gold with rice 10/10
This is one of those threads where I go to OP's page and just upvote every comment he has on the thread. Saves time.
Gold: 5/10
Gold with rice: 6/10

I ended up hand plating 20 grains with 24 karat gold,actually gave it a salty taste that added to it.

Don't try eating pure gold, the rumors may say it's soft but it's not 
I have to say, I recently started playing Fire Emblem and I love your user-name.
Op with rice, 9/10
Sick username, brah. I'm playing through fire emblem right now.

Surprisingly funny.

Thank you for your suggestion.
I don't need gold, just seeing others giving me an excuse to eat food is good enough (:
Eat gold on rice! No, don't.
bit late but YES YOU USE THE RIGHT SMILEY FACE (:
*"Fuck you, heres gold"*

- Everyone.
>I don't need gold.

Can those words even be used together in a sentence like that?


Don't I need gold?

I guess that works right
Riiiiiigggghhhhttt..... (using shifty mobile, so insert Krunk saying "riiiiigggghhhht"  here)
You heard him. Gold. Over rice. I want that rating op. 
Have you tried gold over rice?
He meant for you to try gold+rice.
Thank you for your suggestion.
No, fuck you. You're getting gold and you're going to fucking like it. 
Lol!!! I drooled in laughter at this... Oh man... Happy thanksgiving 
love you
On a completely unrelated note, Fire Emblem is awesome.
But how does that gold taste over rice?
the irony
Rice 10/10  
Rice with gold 10/10
NOOO! Not Gold! For the love of God don't give me GOLD!!!
I would hate it.
DO_U_EVN_SPAGHETTI was supposed to get the gold, not Eliwood_of_Pherae

That's not oh wait, i guess it is, thats /u/Eliwood_of_Pherae.
So are we all in agreement that /u/DO_U_EVN_SPAGHETTI is definitely, completely, absolutely, (un)officially the Best OP Ever? Can we get like a really shitty internet plaque for him or something?
does [this](http://i.imgur.com/8yU3Z6k.png?1) work?
Should we start an OP of the year award?
And he's 14! Can you believe that. I was already psyched about him. Read all the way down and he says he's 14. He's gonna be a funny grown up.

Ice cream, only because as a kid I was often lectured on not being able to have two good things together as in "You wouldn't eat ice cream with rice. That's why you can't have X with Y"
I read this earlier and tried it out, I got to say it sweetened the rice and made it not too bad (:
Well yes I've have since discovered to sweet rice desserts and puddings, but six year old me wasn't cultured yet.

Edit :  still not the same as any flavor ice cream on plain steamed jasmine rice
TIL that OP *does* deliver.
Totally not a bundle of sticks 
OP may not be a fag after all..
Are you retarded? He's completely full of shit. First of all, it's utterly unlikely that he would have on-hand most of the ingredients involved here. He even had a pizza on-hand. Secondly, a lot of the suggestions involve prep-time (pancakes? Chocolate-covered bacon?). Third, add in the whole 'cooking rice' bit, barring him having made about ten pounds worth in advance.

Tie this all together with the fact that he's chain-posted responses in a completely miniscule timeframe. He didn't do a single thing listed here. He even did the 'lol my webcam's broke sry guiz' to explain why he had no proof.

In [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2np694/what_tasty_food_would_be_distusting_if_eaten_over/cmftvzn) he found the post, found a potato, *baked it in an oven*, ate it with rice, and posted the results... in six minutes. 
The potato one is plausible for the fact that you can get frozen microwave jacket potatoes, well at least in England you can. 
I always have pizza at my house. Who doesn't?
First of all, he explained that he does a bunch of them and then responds to all the ones he did at the same time.

Second of all, idk about you, but I've had potato with rice before. If he had also, he didn't have to do it because he already knew what it tastes like.

Finally, I've said everything jokingly. No need to be such a douche.
> he explained that he does a bunch of them and then responds to all the ones he did at the same time   

/u/Frostiken is pointing out that he responded 6 minutes after the comment was posted. What you're saying makes this more implausible (that OP did multiple requests within those 6 minutes).
He said he did the *potato* one within 6 minutes.

Idk about you, but I already know what potato and rice tastes like. Odds are, so does OP. He could've just answered as soon as he saw it.
Nice job using the potato as reference, with the user name and all.
You don't know that OP isn't completely BSing us here. 
OP isn't digiorno 
Ive never seen OP deliver to this level, top thread
we're not sure about that.....
yes he does. pancakes. to fat people. 
On Tuesdays, for money.
By the looks of his karma, it looks more like OP receives. 
touché
Did he post proof? At all?
It seems *so* implausible that OP wouldn't have a camera, particularly since he said he doesn't have a webcam and then when someone said "just use your phone" he didn't respond.

But I really really want to believe, and the ratings seem very realistic
Well, he's 14. He could just, you know, not have a phone. 
Yeah, maybe.
OP has a modern cellphone.  
http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2e2e9u/  

Edit:

> ratings seem very realistic
 
Based on what? He's probably pulling those numbers out of his ass.

I suppose I meant the comments he gave with the ratings, not the numbers themselves
*I WANT TO BELIEVE*
It's not delivery. It's digiorno over rice. 
Thank you for your suggestion
Time to close the thread, nothing else in it will be better than this.  
Thank you for your suggestion.
Toenails. If not, refried beans
You can have refried beans without rice?
What do you normally eat refried beans with, pasta?
Toenails... *"What tasty food"* Does that mean- ? 
Dont act like you havent
Toenails: -3/10

Toenails with rice: -2/10

Think this is stupid? I ate it WITHOUT ANY MILK.
But you wouldn't *dare* try refried beans with rice. You're not completely mad. 
Nice reference there 
What is OP refrencing here?


I need to know he seems chill.
Damn, you a comedian?
Sorry, right this way sir.
Durian
That shit's expensive!
This one is actually pretty good. .. if you like the taste of durian
You just gave me horrible flashbacks of trying to kick the durian around the city in Super Mario Sunshine.
Kicking a durian sounds a bit too much like Russian roulette.
Came here for this too! (By the way, it's fantastic!")
Hey! As a south east asian I eat durian with rice all the time... One of my favourite food combos :)

Edit: still want OP to try it, go OP!
As someone who walked through street markets as a young lad in Malaysia and Singapore, I feel like that's a bit cruel to OP. And OP's family. And OP's neighbours. Damn that stuff smells...
The smell makes my mouth water, I find it really weird how most people can't take it. Salted/dried fish, though... now that stinks!
Throwing a rotten durian through a neighbors window was the second worst thing I ever did to them. 

A fate worse than death. 
What is the worst thing you did ?
He ate the rotten durian and then threw his resulting bowel movements through the window
Oh, fuck. 

Only ever told my ex wife about this one. 

They had a weird driveway, the street was higher than the level of their house. So they had to drive up a steep hill to get to the street. 

The lady of the house said some fucked up shit, so I decided to do what I do best. Take revenge to a new level. 

This nice little town had very cold winters, and when we bought the house years before, the old owners left years of old motor oil. 

I disposed of it by coating their entire driveway with motor oil, the night of a freeze, which happened to be before a work day,  

The motor oil made the driveway to slippery to drive up, and the freeze lasted over a week. 

Fuckers tried going up their slicked driveway in their 2wd Honda, Did not work out in their favor. 

When I was studying in Thailand, a Cambodian guy took durian up to their room. Roommates came back. Hilarity ensues. "We're going to force him to eat all of it, right now."
OH NO
Maybe OP will get back to this one after he finds a broadsword to hack the thing open.
Or a mace!
Fruit Ninja is that you?
Durian with sticky rice is fucking delicious PLS

Coleslaw. Kfc coleslaw.

This sounds good
Says /u/dickcockboner...
Fuck off
cranberry sauce
No, it's I buried Paul!
Cranberries!
This one sounds gross. Probably mostly because i despise cranberry sauce. 
I mean first off it really isn't a SAUCE. Secondly I don't see how people like it with turkey and dressing seems more like a dessert to me. I just don't get it.
Is it weird that I just eat it by itself? It's my favorite part of Thanksgiving 
It's weird that it's your favorite part.
Its a sauce. Youre supposed to heat it. Nobody does, but that is the intended preparation.
I might have to try that. I like cranberries fresh, dried, or as juice. I should like sauce, but I don't. there has to be a way to fix this.
Makes sense.
It's hot when I cook it, but even when it's piping hot it's still really thick, like a jam.

No one likes cranberry sauce, yet I make it every year because traditiooonnnn.
I make my own too, and I fucking love it. But I just use pineapple juice and honey. Ends up more like a jelly, but man is it awesome. 
Vanilla Extract.
It smells *so good*
But tastes like the devil pissed into a bottle.
This kills the OP.

When I was in elementary school, I had a really good friend that I used to always hang out at her house after school. Her whole family was vegetarian, so whenever I came over, I was introduced to a lot of food that I was not used to eating at home..... 

I will never forget the day that when it was time for dinner, we ate strawberries and bananas over rice..... 

And that is my answer to what tasty food would be disgusting if eaten over rice. 
See that's even more ridiculous because what dessert even had meat it in the first place? LITERALLY ALL DESSERTS ARE ALREADY VEGETARIAN. Damn. Could've given you some cake or some shit.
I don't think Jello is vegetarian...
Well,  it's certainly not vegan
Hot Cheetos
Hot Cheetos + bean dip = AMAZING
^ this guy knows what's up. 
Reading this thread randomly months later, I'm thinking of one word. And that word is "Marijuana".
Have you ever had hot cheetos and bean dip? It's the bomb

You may have just introduced me to the first cheese I might not like.
If the maggots are dead it means the cheese has turned poisonus
When I saw the orange envelope, this sure as fuck wasn't what I was expecting.
I'm a Wisconsinite, this is definitely a first. 
it's also illegal. i don't know why they would want to make that crazy shit
I don't believe I have that here, sorry.
Be glad.
Buy a packet of live maggot lizard food and stuff em in some cheese.
Its cool. Its illegal in the only place you can buy it anyway.
You oughtta google that.
Cheese with maggots in it. Literally means worm cheese. Is a delicary in sardinia and sicily.
It actually literally means rotten cheese (though it does have larvae in it), and can be found in Sardinia and Corsica, not Sicily.
It is also said to be a fairly strong aphrodisiac.

This is normally tasty?
Very much so... in the way most delicacies are.

Put edemame on rice in a rice cooker, then use beer instead of water. 

That was the best entry in that episode.
This is OP's way of letting you down easy
Holy jesus. Number one post. I love you all so much.

I love you too. <3
Only number 2 right now. Hitmarkers still reign supreme.
Have you ever been in a kitchen with just peanut butter and rice? 

I have, I know how that feels,. You look at it and think "I shouldn't, should?" and then you're cooking the rice, in the back of your mind you know what will happen but you're happy to lie to yourself "I'll have just rice, it'll be fine" 

Thne the rice is cooked, it's the moment of truth, would you ever possibly put peanut butt.. oh too late, there's peanut butter on the rice now, and it's kind of meling, well stir it in I guess. then you take your first tentative mouthful. Let me not understate this, sweet lord in heaven is that shit good. 

If angels wings were to fall off, then be eaten by those angels and shat into a bowl it could never taste anything half as good as this, you know it, the rice knows it, it has found its soul mate, they were made to be together but held apart by forces unknown, welcome to culinary romeo and juliet, you just became cookeries shakespeare, and you're just a little ashamed of it.

Then it's happening, you're shoveling globules of peanut-rice-mess into your face hole, you know it's not right, you know your parents would cry if they had seen what you had become but it is so damn good. 

Then it hits you, you know in marathons there's the concept of the wall, I've never run anything more than to the toilet and only then when very drunk and finding out what redigested vomit tastes like (honestly, not as good as peanut-rice, just saying) but there it is, the wall. 

You look at the rice, it looks back at you, slightly gleaming with it's fatty nutty covering and you both know what's going to happen. You're already full, you've eaten as much as you could, but there's half left. 

you sit back, looking at what you've made, remembering how it felt and rolling in the afterglow of the taste. You don't have an option, the boot camp sergeant of your brain has told you to eat and by fucking god will you eat. 


I've never hated myself more than when I was shoveling peanut rice into my mouth, bearly enjoying it anymore, just knowing I couldn't leave this in the bin, what if someone saw? 

And you're down to the last mouthful, you've made it this far, but you pause, thinking about the emotional trauma you've been through just for something that wasn't just rice to eat, carefully stabbing it with the fork, you pause, you breath in deep, inhaling that scent, knowing that this is it, this is all that's left, you place it gently on your tongue, rolling it around to ensure full flavour absorption. You swallow.

Then it's over. if there's ever been a more uncomfortable contentment I imagine it happens in truckers bathrooms. you've been through hell and back and you know it. 

Peanut butter and rice, it's bad, but goddamn if it isn't gods only gift to us then he did a terrible job with everything else. 

Now I know what you're thinking, this guy just switched between you and I maybe a hundred times in this post, why would he do that, clearly he has a mastery of the english language but why would he make such a simple mistake?

It's simple dear redditor, we're in this together, like peanut butter on rice, we weren't supposed to be and yet we are. I cant predict the future, but I know next time you go to the kitchen you'll see the rice, you'll see the peanut butter and an hour later you'll know just how right I was, we were in this together, it was you and I and maybe, just maybe, one day, you too will be brave enough to tell the world as I am doing now. 
Wtf did I just read
Peanut satay is a peanut butter sauce, I suggest trying that! Awesome on chicken. 
Satay is actually grilled meat on a stick. Its traditionally served with the peanut sauce you refer to but "satay" doesn't actually refer to the sauce. The sauce is delicious though. Not peanut butter. Its more savory and not very sweet.

Sauce: I'm Singaporean. We love our foods. (Satay isn't quite Singaporean but we get a lot of it.)
God, isn't it?
This comment made me cry and then fap furiously. I don't know why.

Scale from never to always, how often do you partake in Reddit with rice?
Depends on my mood and business.

I'm on Reddit at minimum an hour a day, and on weekends it goes up to 5-6 hours a day.

Bacon.

*stabbed by a member of the Bacon Order*
Already did chocolate bacon so obviously I did bacon beforehand!

Bacon: 10/10

Bacon with rice: 7/10 


Bacon and rice are my kids favorite dish. 
Try this again, only next time, throw some butter, like, a lot of butter, in a skillet. Throw in your crumbled bacon, some green onions, finely chopped, an egg, and your rice. Add soy sauce, mix it, scrambling the egg until the egg is thoroughly cooked. Maybe add some peas or carrots or celery or skittles or fruity pebbles or wtfever. Works best with 1-2 day old steamed rice. Super simple, delicious.

Oh, yeah. Yellow corn.
Wait why is it only 7/10? Bacon's great. Rice is great. Bacon and rice sounds, albeit, a tad unconventional... But great. 
Bacon and rice (with egg) is a standard breakfast where I live. You can get those from fastfood chains.
Bacon and rice is good unless the bacon is really oily and then the oil soaks into the rice and it's kinda gross.

Well played.
Wow,  rice is getting pretty expensive these days huh
It's a whole dollar. I don't have a whole dollar.
Squid with rice is 10/10. Squid on its own is really good too. Just prepare it with savory stuff and get it from your local asian supermarket.
Or deep fry the fucker. Then again, everything is better deep fried.
Considering your age, this is the answer that impressed me the most.
Oops. I've been deep on the internet.
"Deep" may have been the worst word to use in this thread
Uhhh
Haha. Disgusting. What the hell.
I'm never letting my kid get on the internet. 
Please don't. Everyone on here is awful, well atleast I am.
can confirm, internet takes us over
Can I just say, you single handedly have made this my favorite AskReddit Thread.  Please, do more.
I'll make sure to in the future!
When are you doing your next thread? It's been 4 months..

You are, without question, one of the funniest people on reddit. I'm crying laughing so hard
Fun dip
Holy fucking shit this question became the top AskReddit thread of all time.
And I was there to see it :')
It also topped out Obama's AMA by 2,000 votes!
A 14 year old eating rice, tops **THE** President of the United States of America.  That's Reddit for ya!
In Reddit's defense, that president is a piece of shit. 
hot wings
I imagine a sticky Bbq sauce or something with rice all stuck to it, I bet it's good
You'd like Hawaiian food. At least some of it. All of it if you like Spam. 
i do like Hawaiian food.  i used to love spam until one night i had a spam and rice dish that gave me food poisoning (it wasnt the spam and rice).  since then i cant even smell it.
Wings and rice is an amazing combination. You get some beer and you've got yourself a good might. 

Pretty sure this is an actual thing. 
That would taste great :)
My mom used to make this for dinner, although she used chicken thighs in place of wings because my dad hates messy foods. We always ate it over rice (I'm pretty sure that was to stretch the meal) and I still get cravings. 
It is great
Shut up our god hasn't spoken
Watermelon
Cotton candy
[OP with this thread](http://i.imgur.com/W8C8kNm.gif) 
It really bothers me that the teeth still show through his wings..
Vegemite
Vegemite tasted good to me one time.  I put it on a sandwhich with an avocado and a piece of spiral cut glazed ham.
Vegemite is DELICIOUS if you eat it with fat, preferably butter. It tastes HORRIBLE without fat.
Cinnamon toast crunch
Rice. Putting rice over rice created infinite cycle of rice. Universe now consists solely of rice.
How the fuck is this thread still going and why is it so high?
Sour patch kids
Marshmallow Fluff
Applesauce
I eat this more often than I should it's pretty yummy.
I don't care if everything OP has said is made up, I received some very bad news today and this thread has at least made me laugh a lot. 
Canned Tuna
What are you talking about??
I used to eat this all the time when I was a poor student. 
If it weren't for canned tuna and rice, I would be dead. 
I've generally had bad experiences mixing tuna with other foods, but that could be because I wasn't very clever in my mixing.
Cook seperate then serve together,  recommend adding onions when cooking the tuna
Yes. Some salt, pepper on that and you've got yourself a meal. 
Add cheese or mayo if the budget stretches to that , but it's fine as is. Sriracha is good too. 

I don't cook the tuna either. Just drained the can and mixed it through the hot rice and that warmed it up enough. 
I used to make "cheesy tuna rice" in college all the time. So fucking good.
I used to add tuna to Campbell's Condensed Tomato soup... It was edible, but I'm glad those days are over.
That concoction sent chills down my spine 
[Have you ever tried cum in rice??](http://imgur.com/DBt2tcp)

Cinnamon Toast crunch? I don't know I'm eating them now, and if rice were to suddenly appear upon my cereal, I'd be upset. 
first thread that I completely read through its entirety, and was genuinely amused by the entire thing. thanks OP. you fucking delivered... instead of gold, I would like to send you some of the worlds best toilet paper... your cinnamon ring is going to need it.

Holy shit
Multi-grain crackers
I'm a Vietnamese and I eat rice my whole life. This is a nice question. At first I cannot think of anything else, but then I realize the answer is very simple: Rice needs supportive food so every finished/complete food that is made to be eat alone, it can't go with rice. For e.g a bowl of mixed salad with lots of mayonaise, I bet it tastes like shit with rice.
Rice (specifically white steamed-rice) is such a blank canvas that there's really nothing you could add which would turn from tasty to detestable. 

The only thing I could think of would be something that you don't typically chew mixed with rice, so you're forced to chew it. Raw oysters on the half-shell come to mind. The flavor would still be ok, but chewing might put some people off.


You are supposed to chew oysters. If you swallow them without chewing you'll only taste the brine, might as well drink salt water 
It's all well and good until it gets stuck between two teeth, and then flops around like a wanna-be Jolly Rancher as you try to tongue it out from where it's stuck. I wonder how big an oyster is compared to a Gonorrhea pustule.  
I was thinking exactly this
Which is also why I would have suggested a jawbreaker over anything.

Hehehe.
Yeah, so far the most disliked things tend to be clashes of texture rather than taste. 
I agree with this guy. For various reasons (mainly poverty) I've eaten all kinds of things over rice (and certainly sounds like OP has by now, too) and it's just so bland on it's own it's hard to come up with something that would do this. The raw oyster thing, though, that might do it.
When I'm hungry and lazy I reheat left over rice and drench it in soy sauce.
Just picture the soft, mucusy blob of fishy-saltwater taste as it rolls around in your mouth and gets stuck in between your teeth. **shudder**

Chili
What is wrong with you... You monster!
have you never had chili over rice? shit's delicious. can also help your chili go farther if you need to feed a lot of folks with it.
It's like red beans and rice, except totally gross! 
Chili and rice is commonplace in Hawaii. I was surprised when I found out most people *don't* eat chili over rice.
Wait, what? I thought chili and rice just went together everywherez
Nah, people in the US northwest think it's weird. What's weird is that they serve chili with a maple bar (or, less frequently, a cinnamon bun).
I don't know what a maple bar is, but I know cinnamon bus and **what the fuck.**

Chili and rice is delicious, ate it in Texas, eat it in Ohio, had it in New England as well. 
It's basically [a Long John with maple flavored icing](http://pastmycurfew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Maple-Bar.jpg).
US south here, I have leftover chili and some rice. You just gave me an awesome idea 
You won't regret it.
Wait, people eat chili by itself? Why have I never thought of that? In my house, curries, stews, chilis, and sometimes even soups are always eaten over rice.
 From Wisconsin. I can't eat chili without noodles. I'll have to try rice

Ever tried fresh strawberries and Oreos?  Tastes like strawberry cheesecake. 
I haven't, but now I'm going to have to!
chocolate, icecream, syrup, peanut butter, jam ... 
Nothing, rice goes with everything.
Ranch dressing
Not OP (but, hot damn, I wish I was) but I can deliver.

Ranch dressing: 10/10

Ranch dressing with rice: still 10/10

I'm only 7 years old. Wait no.
Cream cheese/brie/ sour cream. 
Live maggots.

Funny story about Vandalia, IL. My room mate, long ago was working at KFC-Taco Bell, more than 10 years ago. When they opened in the morning the whole kitchen floor was covered in maggots. Something about grease pooling under the kitchen floor and breading the maggots, who's population this morning surged. 

He says they closed the store for the day and the supervisors stupidly had them just mix a random barrage of cleaning chemicals to kill the maggots and clean the floor. They all got sick and had breathing problems so that failed miserably. 

Eventually, the health department shut it down and told them they had to close or seriously remodel the kitchen because of major problems. So they shut down the store. About a year later El Nuevo Rancho bought the place and opened up without any remodeling.

I always joked you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the rice and maggots. You'd have to look for wiggling rice.
Buttery popcorn. Gross. 
HEY I DID THIS.

It wasn't gross. It was just rice with the occasional crunch.

Potatoes. I was served potatoes over rice in Ecuador, and it was the biggest pile of starch, and I worked hard to eat it all. No. Starch on starch may be a thing in Ecuador, but I was not a fan.
I hope you're happy with the monster you've unleashed.
Listen. As a dominican whose had plenty of "arroz con leche" over his lifetime, rice makes everything better. Yes, even oranges could potentially be delicious with rice. Im fairly confident. 
Late reply but arroz con leche is awesome. Im curious though. Do make it over there more 'watery' or is it a pudding type. In Nicaragua we do both.

Honestly, white rice is pretty neutral. Add anything and it will make a dish.
I would say that generally its more of a pudding consistency. But I have seen both as well. 
Pizza: 10/10
Pizza on top of rice: 2/10 (it's a 2 only because there's pizza)

Cottage cheese
Ketchup, white vinegar (I love vinegar so idk), wilted lettuce (from being left out all day with moisture), unsweetened cocoa, crystal light
I feel like this thread was made for college students 
So, Once when I was about 12, I put all of these items over rice at the same time:
1. Peanut Butter
2. Jelly
3. Parmesean Cheese
4. Salt & Pepper
5. Ham
6. More Cheese (I don't remember what kind anymore)
7. Barbecue sauce

I remember finishing the bowl, but that was only because my mother was watching me eat it. It was the worst thing I've eaten. It has been 7 ish years since then, but I still put most of those things on rice, save the peanut butter and jelly. Those don't mix with rice well. 

Ah, so *this* is where the rice joke came from.

As for the food: kiwis. 
12 gold FUCK.

Fruit Loops.
Peassoup with rice. I like it
Jello salad with mandarin oranges and marshmallows. And coconut.
Hot dogs
Strange. We eat hot dogs with rice all the time. It's the quintessential schoolkid's lunch.
I personally think rice could go well with anything, just depends on how you serve the rice or what form it is in.  Something sweet=Rice pudding, something dry=rice cakes, something warm=cooked rice, however cold I'm having a problem it could be good in salads but I just don't think it could go with a sandwich.
Let me tell you what's not disgusting. Peanut butter on rice is incredible. 
It has to be something completely ridiculous.... Regular butter on rice, maple syrup on rice, watermelon on rice? This is so hard!

If you ever do this again then do Marshmallows. You know like Rice Crispys treats/squares but just using normal rice. 
Sunflower seeds
rice and junior mints!
At the place I cook, we do rice cooks on pizzas. It's the sauce and pizza toppings on a bowl of rice. Gross 
This sounds like something I should have done. I love rice so much that I buy it 15lbs at a time (would buy more but space prohibits it) and eat at least a cup on a daily basis.

Croutons
that actually sounds like it might be pretty good. Garlic & herb rice with croutons? I'd try it.
Corn flakes
pop rocks candy
Whip cream. Makes it worse if the rice is fresh out of the cooker or just microwaved. The steaming rice combined with the room temperature creaminess makes for a pretty awful sensation in your mouth.

I don't eat food "over" rice, I put the rice on top of it.

All this reminds me of loco moco. It's like, this Hawaiian dish (if I remember correctly) that is a base of rice, topped with a beef patty, topped with a fried egg, topped with gravy. And onions, but that's optional. You should try it out if you haven't already.
Hey OP, I'm super late, but you know meatballs and sauce you put on spaghetti? Well it tastes like shit with rice.
Sticky lollipop
One of my friends is weird. He and I are south-asian, so it's common for us to eat rice and curry (the curry can be meat, potatoes, other veggies, w/e). Also not uncommon for us to eat fried rice.
So yeah, rice for us is usually paired with something warm, spicy, salty, and meaty.

...He eats his rice with grapes (alongside the curry)
Holy crap OP, I just returned to this thread to see if it was still going 160k comment karma!??!?
Half the top karma comments aren't even food and the other half aren't even tasty, like wtf guys I might as well just say drywall

This is actually good. I did this a lot when I was little and my friend's mom was weirded out by it when I ate at her house one time. She tried it a couple of years later and said she thought it was weirdly good.
You have to get the right amount of ketchup though or else it's too weird of a texture.

marmite: 0/10 or 10/10 "you'll either love it or hate it".
marmite + rice: 1/10 or 11/10 either masks the (to me disgusting taste) marmite or makes it even better. vegemite is a suitable alternative to marmite.

You're hilarious, marry me.
I'm Viet and I eat rice every fucking day and the worse topping I've ever put on rice is canned tuna. It tastes like if you ate a fly that ate Satan's barf and landed on a piece of horse shit, died, partially decomposed, eaten by a retarded owl, and was spat out.
Ouch. I eat canned tuna with rice all the time. Maybe you got bad tuna.
The retarded owl was key.

Not too bad, gives the rice a bit of sweet flavor when you eat it.

Can't do alcoholic cocktails, only 14 :(
I made it through the ice cream, and thought, this is something my son would do.  I am now going to go see what my kid is up to...

Sure. You know what semen, shit, and vomit would all be disgusting on rice but I feel like that doesnt count because they would all be horrendous in general. For fucks sake we could say pistachio ice-cream if we really want to go that route but in all seriousness I think that jello on rice would be the worst. I mean it might not taste like the worst think ever, but that texture might actually kill me. 
Spaghetti (sauce and pasta)

Chocolate
I've been racking my brain and I think a golden contender would have to be......PICKLES! 
Oreo's. 
Carmel.

I don't really like it that much though, so I'm biased.

If you like spaghetti why don't you try spaghetti with everything?

Gotta be icecream
I think kiwi will be bad. 
Or surströmming, but I would feel bad for you if you tried. 
Rice cooked with Coconut milk, fine. Rice with Coconut flakes, disgusting. 
Nutella? 
Ketchup, bananas, mayonnaise, caramel sauce, and chocolate chip muffin.

I was thinking separately, but all mixed together would add a whole new level of disgusting if that's what you're really looking for.

baked beans, the combination is horrible...
Spaghetti with marinara sauce.  

I was in culture shock once because it was the first time traveling in a country without my native language.  Ordered some spaghetti thinking it would be a familiar comfort food.  Nope.  

Came as rice on a plate with the pasta over that and the sauce over that and then finally a fried egg.  

These days, it might be better but then I was overwhelmed and it was just the most disgusting thing I'd ever encountered.  Ended up going back to my hostel room and eating crackers or something.
Spaghetti Carbonara sauce... So Carbonara sauce.
Candle wax.
Now, I want rice. Lunch issue solved!

Just in general try eating it with yoghurt.  

I've heard before that yoghurt tastes a bit different in america compared to eurpoe, so make sure to get something that says greek yoghurt (this kind of yoghurt is not limited to greece, but thats just the way its marketed usually I guess).

It's not disgusting, in the contrary imo it's extremely delicious!! Make sure that the rice is steaming and them put the cold yoghurt on top and eat it together.  

May sound weird if you've never heard of it before but just try it.

Black coffee and rice

The original Jelly Belly buttered popcorn jelly beans were pretty gross because the texture didn't match the expectations set by the flavor. So buttered popcorn.
I ate buttered popcorn with rice once. It wasn't bad, actually. Just rice and the occasional crunch.
Someone earlier suggested jelly beans, and popcorn flavor was actually my first thought. I think they'd go reasonably well together, apart from the texture.
Bananas
Cake.
maple syrup?
Please upload a picture of the mess in your kitchen when you are done.

Milk and fish. Also a Filipino dish. Cough.

Cinnamon toast crunch cereal would probably be a little gross.
Nope. Milk + rice + sugar & spice = yummy.

In fact, I may do this next time I make rice pudding. Sounds delicious.
Ice cream
BBQ. My wife and I tried this the other day. Pulled pork with yum yum sauce from wal mart. I know I'm late and you may already be done. 
We eat barbecue exclusively with rice. -- Filipino
I think it was the way we prepared it. It came out disgusting. Any suggestions next time?

Two ways. First, you can just make a normal barbecue then eat it with rice. That's what we usually do with everything, three times a day. Rice + "Ulam" (viand). The second way is to make barbecue fried rice (garlic, then egg, then rice, stir fry) then just add the chopped barbecue on top.
I like the stir fry idea. Thanks! 
Robitussin cough syrup.
Tuna! Has anyone said tuna yet?
What on earth. This is my lunch, like 3 out of 7 days a week. It's not gross at all.

Toast with Cinnamon sugar!
I tried scrambled eggs with rice. Did not go well.
Just tried it, was not good, but would probably eat again.
Weird. Where I come from, scrambled eggs and rice is *breakfast*.
Probably because we (Vietnamese) are not used to eating buttery food with rice.
Oh that makes sense. I'm Filipino, and not only do we eat buttery food with rice, we also put butter *on* our rice.
milk and cereal
candy apples.
Nachos (To be clear, tortilla chips with melted cheese on top, salsa and jalapenos optional)

Shepard's pie, if I'm not too late to the party.
Charleston Chew
Bacon cheese dog
My SO eats spaghetti sauce on rice and it looks so disgusting. He swears it's the same as noodles but ugh, I judge him hardcore every time. 
I put cottage cheese on rice once, it wasn't very good. Spaghetti on rice though! That was good. I DO even spaghetti.

I feel like for this post to be true, you just bought $500 in groceries, ate about 7000 calories and there is no way you just happened to have this much rice  laying around. I want to believe, but....
What kind of rice are you using? 
Pudding.
Rice with marmite/Vegemite/yeast extract spread that is high (very high) in salt.
Edit: Someone give OP gold. He is spending all this money and food for our knowledge!!!

Have you tried it with a **ham and cheese sandwich**?  Sounds tasty.
Jello

Edit: someone already suggested that so I'll say bananas
I found something very good with rice (I know that wasn't the question):

Hot steamed rice with brown sugar makes something boring pretty good -- rice melts the sugar some.

Makes me buy food at this one crummy Chinese joint every day almost.

I wash it down with Snapple Peach Ice Tea. (Not frigging Lipton's -- just read the ingredients of that crap.)
Lucky charms

A cup of Room temperature water. 
Red Pepper Hummus. Or any kind of hummus, but Red Pepper is the best. 
Op I don't even care if you're making all this up, Jesus Christ this is making me laugh so hard 
mac and cheese..
Bakers chocolate.

Yo, OP if you like this type of stuff you should check out [this!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHAlq6i5pso). It's a Asian game show where these guys try to come up with the tastiest but most bizarre rice combination! They also cook with other stuff!  
I've had a few people show me this, thanks man, I'll have to check it out later tonight.

But the real question is why do so many redditors know about Asian game shows?
Dude, their fucking crazy man. [Here's a little taste.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GakiNoTsukai/)
I recommend silent library, It's what got me into them.   

I watch silent library all the time!
Nice! Your like the coolest op ever. So whats your favorite punishment?
Onions.
You have a crap ton of money to walk to the store, buy recomended crap, and eat it. By the way, try Fruit Salad with rice. For those who don't know what Fruit Salad is for some unknown reason, basically salad but with random fruits. No veggies
This all sounds good to me.
Some of this was, some of this was just godawful.
Two separate requests. 1 Of them takes more time to cook. One of them I haven't tried but would like too.

Chili

Broccoli
This thread is great, keep it up man.

I don't know if you'll see this or not, but I chuckled and upvoted when I read the fourth edit. Goodjob.
I was in the hospital recently for stomach issues. The doctor said to mix Activia yogurt with rice to help balance out the bacteria in my gut.... I decided to eat the yogurt, then the rice instead. 
Probably pizza. I'm not even sure if the logistics needed to pull that off.

And what in the world did your parents think you were up to?
Ketchup and crushed potato chips

Chocolate?  Who eats rice with chocolate,  come on. 
They have chocolate rice krispy bars 
Energy Bar
I know something that would be awesome. This is a good idea, as opposed to the bad one you wanted.

It would be a chocolate cake, wrapped in a vegan pizza, and put on a bed of rice. Cooked over a hot plate
Rice and Beer.
did you know that rotting rice tastes like rotten cheezy rice, and the inverse works. Add cheese to rice and you will puke. But, only if you know what rotten rice smells/tastes like in the first place. You will never find cheese on a Asian rice dish.

Do you even spaghetti with rice?
Yes, do you even?
I think the texture would make me ill lol
Durian or balut
Brownies? 

Maybe put rice on something, cover the rice with cheese and heat it up? 

Bake a cake, add rice to the batter?

Dude not even kidding Asians eat pretty much everything with rice.  I've seen one dude eat chili with rice, steak with rice, even rice with breakfast stuff like eggs.  lol weirdos.
What's wrong with steak with rice though?
Scrolled down pretty far and nobody said cottage cheese.

Tasty combo I ate a lot as a kid.
Watermelon
For whatever reason I imagine OP's responses to be said as fast as they can possibly be said and that they immediately move to the next one at break neck speed. 
Coffee

BBQ Sauce
Tuna salad please. 
I really can't think of a single thing.  Rice is true neutral.

I am so confused by this thread, how is op getting so many upvotes/replies with zero proof whatsoever that he's actually doing all these things? 
Probably late, but Coke!

[Here's a sub dedicated to these same guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/GakiNoTsukai)
You want gross? My dumbAss thought I was master chef one night and said hell, I can do chicken fried rice!! Ooh fuck was I in for the worst bite of riced food in my entire life. 

First I got a half breast of chicken and cooked it, tore it apart, didn't season it since I was gonna cook it all together anyway. 

Minute rice? 1 minute later rice is done.

So sweet right? Got my rice, my chicken, now how do I make this shit taste good? I threw butter (bout a quarter stick) in the rice let that shit get all buttery melty. Grabbed some Lawry's seasoning salt had a few sprinkles of that on the rice because it spices up everything. Do what else? 

Garlic powder. It's good on....stuff? W/e, throw it on.

Last but not least needed soy sauce! A LOT. I don't even remember how much it was but enough until the chicken and rice were kinda golden fried lookin. I mixed all that shit up and was thinking I'm gonna smash this shit
And my gf is gonna be super jealous I made Chinese and wasn't sharing.

I took one bite if the half pound monstrosity of a dish. I immediately started gagging. My girlfriend observing is trying to hold back the laughter. I made sure I rinsed my mouth out with mouthwash after. I can't even describe the taste. It was like what a raw salty fart would taste like. PLEASE DO NOT EVER EVER TRY TO MAKE THIS AT HOME YOU WILL REGRET IT


I think you're just a really bad cook.
This is true. I've learned my lesson at playing random ingredient man.
Mangos
As an Asian, nothing.
Sashimi
Didn't read the thread yet but frozen yogurt, especially outside during summer time. slurp slurp.
Wine...chardonnay.
Yogurt.
I'm gonna say Gushers. 
Egg whites or whipped cream.

Interesting! Well that made my night.
Lucky Charms
Bacon, especially when it's crispy and hard.
Dude, make this a youtube series. I'd watch this over a lot of things, and you are friggin hilarious.
I may consider doing this in the future!
How the hell did this get 3X gold? 
I don't even know.
This thread is unquestionably the most important thing I've read all day. 
I hope this is very ~~useless~~ useful for you!
Oh it is. I'll be sure to work it into one of my research papers this semester. 
For math class or what?
I actually haven't taken a math class in almost two years... Nope, the only research papers I'm writing right now are a history one (on the relationship between political party machines and immigrant groups in 19th century New York) and two political science ones (one which is thematically related to that history one, and another which is basically just a glorified biography of Karl Marx). I dunno, I'll probably use your thread in the Marx one. 
Donuts 
Oh damn, I wish I could have been here when you still had rice for testing.

So what's the deal here?  You're 14 and you have infinite amount of monies to do this?  
Ice cream maybe would be something that not go good with rice. Or possible bread.
Cinnamon
I'm part Filipino.  Rice goes with everything.  
Grape Nuts Cereal

Ice cream. 
Man, we're trying pretty hard for some original /r/AskReddit threads, aren't we?
This is the BEST thread I have ever read ! SO FUNNY! awesome comment interaction ! I r8  8/8 m8 !
Damn 8/8 m8? Thats g8
Milk shakes...
Fondue
Human Jerky.
Fudge
At your leisure try dipping cheese-its into yogurt sometime. A friend of mine has the same hobby and discovered that combination. Surprisingly tasty.
Have you tried ketchup with rice? I personally love it :)

Well OP I've got nothing to add to this but you are an excellent OP and you deserve all the credit.

Maybe try out a warm donut over rice.
Have you done doughnuts?
ice cream
A grilled cheese sandwich with rice. While we're there tomato soup with rice too.

I will follow your honest opinion
Tomato soup and rice doesn't sound that bad.
I can vouch for ruffles potato chips and tomato soup. It is food for the gods!
twinkies would be disgusting

Chapstick. I don't think it's toxic...
Crushed Oreo's
Guinea pig.
Ctrl+f sriracha

really?
Crushed Oreo's
Snickers. Snickers alone, satisfies. 
how in the fuck do you eat pancakes with rice? is that enjoyable? sure rice doesn't have the opposite taste of pancakes.... but imagine thick bread-like substance with small bloated grains with it. that sounds awful.
my poop
711 hot dog sober
It took me a while to click on this thread, because how stupid is a list of foods, right?

I was wrong.
That's what a ton of people are missing out on!
Peanut butter and jelly 
Popsicle. 
grape soda?
Potted meat
Oatmeal?
Bread
This thread would have been just as entertaining with mashed potatoes. 
Idk if it has been said yet, but ice pops. Those things you freeze that cut the shit out of the sides of your mouth. Also called Otter pops apparently. Come in bunches of 100? Know what i'm talking about? Let me know what thats like.
Chocolate Milk :)
I expect to see some pilot for a show on TV in 6 months with OP as the host. A cooking/food show about what foods can be eaten with rice. This will only be season 1.

Season 2 will likely be pasta or bread...or hopefully couscous. 
None of the suggestions seem particularly repulsive, vomit inducing, or gut curdling. The thing is, rice in it's unmodified state (unseasoned) is so neutral that it's along the line of asking which color clashes the most with gray. 

Note - I'm assuming the challenge is to find a single addition, i.e. one fruit, one vegetable, one type of meat, etc.

Edit - rereading, the task is to rate a food by itself first and then add rice and rate the result of the combination. So it seems to me that the food rated first will almost certainly have to be disgusting by itself and that the addition rice wouldn't really do much in the way of enhancing the disgustingness.
Minty M&M's! I added some into my rice when I was seven years old and couldn't finish it because it tasted so disgusting. 

If you added minty gum instead it would probably be even worse. 
Any proof op is doing this ?
CHEESY POOFS

Meatballs. Love this thread. 
This reminds me of a thing I used to do with friends where we would try to come up with a food that wasn't good with either cheese or chocolate. 
Tomato soup. *shudder*
This thread
So...a laptop over rice?
Fruit cocktail.
I love you OP

OP you da real MVP

OP, I just wanted to say congrats on getting over 100k in comment karma. If one person in this world has the right to say "The internet likes me and thinks I'm funny" it is you. Congrats kid :)
Thank you! I'm just shocked that this took off and didn't get downvoted to oblivion like most my posts.
For every post that hits big, you got like 10 that went nowhere. Such is reddit. You certainly hit on an interesting topic that people are willing to engage with you in. Honestly, I think of you kept doing this, maybe with some pictures or even a YouTube channel you might be able to take this somewhere. On the internet, weird works. So work weird ;)
I would love to do a youtube channel, but with the amount of viewers expected means I would have tons and tons of work to do, and I have school, so I don't think I'm ready for that yet.
You could start small. Maybe do something once a month. I've learned in life that if you want to do something you really just got to make it happen even in the smallest of ways. Even if its little baby steps it is better than feeling like you are stuck and giving up on things you want
Easily one of the best threads ever. Original, hilarious, and rice-based. It doesnt get any better then this
You're awesome, OP.
Jolly Ranchers.

Powdered sugar. I feel like the texture would be off.
Thanks for the laughs OP! 
...You *created a new subreddit.*

I think you should be proud of yourself, DO_U_EVN_SPAGHETTI.

Or, should I say DO_U_EVN_RICE.

*crowd boos*
Sirachia
What? Sirachia on rice is the shit!
Wait did we have go suggest bad things?

I can't be the only one wondering how much food OP has at home.
This guy broke reddit, how many votes can you get in a thread?
the spicy powder packs used in instant ramen (preferably shin ramyun brand)
I'm just wondering how you can afford all that stuff. Or it's kinda a waste
Tomato Carrot Juice.
I know I'm extremely late, but I am very curious as to what a Cosmic Brownie over rice tastes like.
Wow. In reading all the replies I realized that this would literally never work with me because I eat every meal regardless of taste...
Karma.
I'm going to go with animal gizzards. Nothing tastes good with them - not even rice.
Werthers 
Sugar water
These are awesome and all but you've got me curious... was DO_U_EVEN_SPAGHETTI already taken or what? 
Nope, I just felt like making that my username, no clue why.

I know I'm late and all but for your own sake just do vinegar and sesame seeds and have seaweed on the side maybe some regular weed (optional) then put in a big plate and eat it for 3 hours.
Brown sugar. 
Avocado or guacamole. Personal favorite!
Why do you do this to yourself!?!?!?!?
I love how everybody wants to believe so badly because it was such a great thread.

It was definitely a good thread.
Scotch 
Bitches!
Mountain Dew Red Alert.
Kraft Singles, OP?  Good luck...
This is the first time I've read every single comment on a front page post. You are like the Reddit Jesus who died in the name of questionable rice toppings.
If you have spare rice... Sardines with rice >:)
Gr8 thread m8, r8 it 8/8
TIL candy tastes bad with rice.
Rock Candy
This is a great thread. OP is awesome.
OP can swim in karma for the rest of his life after this.
All this gold op got and not one single proof that he actually ate anything.
Ironically, my first thought was spaghetti. Then I read your username. There's your answer. 
This thread is the script to a how-to-basic video. 

As for a suggestion, eggs. Good luck OP. May gods light be with you.
This is the best thread ever, simple as that
Toast. I want you to make a toasted rice sandwich.
A1 Sauce
It can't be disgusting already, that's cheating. \*hides*
Ham and cheese hot pocket.
OP, what percentage of your body is now rice?

Are you doing these tests with white rice or brown rice? With seasoning/flavors or plain? 
If you're 14 what the hell do your parents think of your experiments? 

"But Moooooooom it's for SCIENCE!"
OP are you Kurd? Ive never seen anyone from another culture love rice as much.
Semen.
How hungry are you OP, from a scale from 1/10?
Your going to be soooo constipated from all that rice!!!
Gaki no Tsukai did an episode revolving around this a little. [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHAlq6i5pso) [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zHxWQs-9nY)
I am convinced OP is a robot designed to win/break reddit.
How do we know OP is doing these?
Orphan hands
You are my leader.
THIS IS AN AD BY THE RICE COUNCIL AND YOU ALL FELL FOR IT. Ps-OP may never poop again. =/
I need some photos to believe it OP.

Is it weird that this thread made me think of my grandma? Last week I gave her a Twinkie... and she ate it with rice.

So, Twinkies with rice.
Weetabix.
I leave reddit for one day, and this sort of shit happens?

Dude, your comment karma... If you could convert that to rice, I'm pretty sure you could feed starving countries three times over
Surströmming.

Boogers.

In Sweden we often eat something called "Risalamande" which, in our version, is rice with whipped cream and oranges. Sounds really weird but is actually very tasty!

Am I the only one who wants to know what kind of godly rice he's eating and how he's cooking it? 
I think this is the most comment karma I've seen a single person get in one thread, ever. OP you just collected nearly 50k comment karma from one thread.
This thread is pure gold. 11/10 for OP. Try some gold.
Fish and chips (with plenty of salt and vinegar)
This is enough of an answer (ENG SUB) Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende!!  Absolute…: http://youtu.be/z558gS4ocYU

Thanks OP. This thread was the first thing I read this morning & I am now cooking some rice for breakfast. 
Op's mom. 
Tae
Play doh. That shit will fuck you up.
This is the best fucking thread ever.
Toffee.

And as I learnt from bitter experience, anything that comes in oil.
OP's comment karma just had a mad boost like all the Walmart's sales in Southern Illinois on Black Friday. 
I'm gonna do the reverse here and suggest **noodles** on rice.  
Noodles: 10/10  
Noodles with rice: 12/10  

Don't say I didn't warn you.
Way to late, but holy shit OP. You are 14, you should yell at people on COD and not be the coolest person on the internet.

Thank you sir.
Flaming Hot Cheetos.
Whatever man..  
 DO YOU EVEN SPAGHETTI??!  

Yeah didn't think so.
Langos
Waffles?
Black caviar. Not inly will it taste disgusting you will also be disgusted with yourself ruining hundreds of dollars.
This is probably my favourite thread ever.  It's made me giggle a lot more than I should at 6am, in a building full of people. No regrets.
OMFG, are you actually trying all of these?
I find steak burgers and rice are just disgusting together. Yeah that's right! I'm looking at *you* Japan. Just because you could have done it certainly doesn't mean you should have.

As a westerner I am highly offended at their misuse of something so delicious with something so plain. It sits in my belly like a rock and makes me regret it all.

(bring on the downvotes, sorry Asia)
OP do you live in a grocery store?
Of the suggestions that you have tried so far, which one is your favorite?
OP, I hope you didn't vomit! Thanks for this awesome and funny thread :D 
"The kids 14! How dare you"

People actin like they never talked about dicks at that age.
Op is going to hate rice after trying some of these
Upvote for OP's name! Bahahahaha
Holy shit no thread has ever been rocked by OP like this one.
Karma
Have you gone to the ER yet?
This eating Must be taking one hell of a toll on your stomach.
SO. MUCH. GOLD!
I'm a South-East Asian so I have lived my whole life experimenting eating rice with almost everything. What I could pull out of my mind right now are, in descending degree of disgust:

1. bolognese sauce
2. carbonara sauce
3. durian
4. chocolate
5. mayonnaise
6. ice-cream
7. oat
8. muesli
9. certain type of fruit (maybe almost all type of fruit like watermelon, apple, tangerine etc)
10. lettuce or any type of salad (might just be me)
OP funny. You funny OP. 
Dang OP amazing thread you have going here. I am curious about black licorice and peeps. Although not together.. Unless you really want to venture there. 
Are you actually doing all/most of these combinations? Also, did you buy the rice in bulk and how much did you eat?
This is brilliant. If you've tried all of these things with rice, I actually applaud you

Semen. I cant imagine someones future kids would taste good over rice.
Semen: 12/10
Semen with rice: 4/10
Pics or it never happened.
Cashews. Many cashews and rice.
I'm not so sure, it'd be random but I've certainly had cashews in plenty of dishes that are served with rice and they went well. So maybe not the tastiest on their own but I don't think disgusting.
OP you just asked for the impossible, rice in general has not much flavor, nice soft texture and can absorb the flavors of what your eating it with really well.
This is possibly one of the best asks i've ever seen. Very rarely has OP made me legitimately laugh out loud this much in my entire life. I have a feeling we're going to be seeing "x with rice, 10/10" jokes for a while.
OP must have just gone grocery shopping 
This is how legends are made. Such great thread.

I was going to suggest salted fish and rice. Too bad I'm late.
Indian flat bread (not naan. The plain roti).
Whole chicken in a can. 
Peppermint ice-cream 
I know you asked for what would be gross with rice, but I figured I'd tell you something delicious with rice. Go to the store and look for a giant can of Armor Beef Stew. Heat ot up like normal (adding a bay leaf before hand adds awesome gma or, but this is optional), and serve over rice. My boyfriend and I call it "Foodstamps Curry" because it feeds us both and gives us leftovers for like $3-4 depending on sales.
What happened here?
I have to ask OP, how ha feeling this morning?
I'd like to declare this post and its comments one of reddits best. Please someone archive this. 
I've never seen so much Reddit gold. You must be the Michael Phelps of eating food over rice.

Sometimes I really don't understand how Reddit works. A not-so odd question gets asked, and it suddenly gets 8 golds and shitloads of upboats.

On a serious note, seeing how there's lots of rice gurus on here, could someone please help me learn how to make proper rice?

I've been trying to make Basmati rice, but it always comes out pasty and icky. All I know is the 2:1 ratio.
If it's paste like, you used too much water. I don't know much about basmati specifically, but I use a 5:3 ratio for my short grain rice.
Buy a rice cooker. It's cheap.
Frosted Flakes.

These answers all just remind me of the scene in Elf when he puts random ass candy on top of spaghetti.
Pussy.
Cabbage.
I love this shit, i can tell everyone in this thread is just teary-eyed and drooling from being a part of whatever the fuck is happening here...
This is the greatest Reddit thread I have ever read, by far.

Why no rice and peas.
Dog shit. 
Bell pepper.
OP, can you try a grilled cheese with ham?(also what have your parents thought about all this rice stuff?)
Well shit, now it does!
Hey man, just a question for the ricexpert that you are, what brand of rice do you buy? Do they know how rich they are becoming because of you?
Im curious, I know im a week late but did you just have a shit ton of rice and wanted to try new shit? Thats pretty brave op...

For a meme thread, this made me laugh pretty hard.
It would be scallops for me. I once became extremely sick after eating scallops over rice. The taste of it on the way back up will stick with me for the rest of my life. I'm still able to eat rice but if I even imagine scallops I come very close to throwing up.

Not exactly an answer to your question.

But based on the suggestions in the comments, I say Puffed rice is the thing you are looking for, that stuff goes with everything steamed rice doesn't go with. It was invented for that reason.

I thought that, too, since I regularly use cream of mushroom. But this was terrible. I ended up washing off the chicken breasts and eating them with bbq sauce.

Hot dogs and tomatoes. I once knew someone extremely snobby about food, who, having been unsatisfied/ungrateful with her mother making her hotdogs for a quick lunch, decided she should try a "hot dog and tomato over rice dish" to jazz it up. Which just sounds really gross to me, especially without spices.

Not sure if you're aware, but this is now the highest voted thread *of all time*. By a rather wide margin, in fact.
On /r/askreddit Yeah, not on all though.
Is http://www.reddit.com/top/ not the full listing of all-time best posts? It's at the top on there.
Go to all reddits and sort by top all time, there is a post with 51k upvotes.

Edit: if that doesn't work (only default subs I think) go to /r/montageparodies and look at top of all time.
I wonder why that post has so many upvotes?

Kid is 14. Maybe delete this?
Are you seriously policing this entire thread because the kid is 14?  I deleted my comment at first, but after reading your comment history this is pretty weird man.  This is an askreddit thread... I can't tell if your just trying to get karma or if this is actually your own child.  Weird.
No, I just felt badly when I had said something vaguely pornographic and then realized he was a kid, and thought other people might want to know too. I figure most people who said "adult" things wouldn't have if they knew he was a kid. Sorry if you felt policed, I just thought you might want to make an informed decision.
Understandable.  Thank you for a nice reply :)
And you.
I'm taking your word for it, but how was I supposed to know that?
I'm not saying you were - I'm telling you now. He did say it in the comments a couple of times, though. Not sure if it was before you posted.

It's actually pretty good. There's a Chinese dish called Tomato and Eggs with Rice, which is kinda similar to this.
That doesn't sound to appetizing to me but that could be just the fact I do not like tomatoes. 
It never struck me as gross when I first heard of it, so it might be a matter of regional flavours? I personally don't like it, because I like my rice as plain white, and the tomato juices soak into it.

Egg is a pretty common thing to use with rice though. Fried rice, for example, and also just egg (sunny side, or boiled) on rice.

So...are you doing this test for any reason in particular or is this kinda the eat stuff with rice version of jackass?
Rice version of jackass is a pretty great explanation!
Ketchup, I'd imagine.
Any dessert, ice cream, pie, cake, there's no way it can be good.

Thanks! Have a great night (:

Hmm... Guy at work eats brown rice with tomato sauce and a little Tabasco literally every day for lunch. Can't be too bad. Although I don't know what that particular sauce is. 
My brother ate ketchup on rice when we were growing up. Of course, he ate ketchup on everything. It's not terrible on buttered white rice.
Sour cream. And I'm 12.
Ice cream 
Peanut butter 
Fish sauce
Toast
Nope, chili in a slice of bread is amazing. So I'm guessing toast would be the same.
History
Lemons and grapefruit
Oddly enough the left arm of an infant, the right is fine but left over rice is for some reason just terrible

Rice isn't very abrasive so you would be relying on the plate itself. So, a thin bed of rice and a thin food, perhaps Serrano ham? I should think the act of eating that would be sufficient to dislodge your tusks.

So, basically you don't think you raised your children well enough to be able to trust them to use the internet safely without overbearing supervision? 

I had free use of the computer, internet, whatever I wanted since I expressed interest. Probably around 7-8 years old. 

I was told to not click on any flashy banners, ask before clicking any "OK/download/install" buttons, and to not give out personal information when talking with people. And, *most importantly*, that if I fuck up I can go to my parents at any time and they'll *never* be angry. 

Sure, I *did* sometimes have minor screw-ups. I saw boobies. I saw some naked people doing strange things a few times. I accidentally installed some malware and then I had to learn how to reinstall operating systems (A note: I was given a shitty old third hand computer that was basically being thrown out in case this happened). It did absolutely no damage to me psychologically. Kids aren't made of glass.  

I also learned many things, and developed many interests. Instead of "Mooom, why does the moon go around the earth?" and tormenting her with a thousand "But whyyyy"s, I can just google it and stick a "for kids" at the end to make it understandable. 

I learned a lot about socializing by interacting with people - something I had always struggled with, likely due to my early childhood. I was always safe and completely anonymous. 

I met my boyfriend (another note: I'm a female. The username is related to an old post) when I was 9 years old on an online game. We were good friends for 5 years, then in an LDR for 3. Now we live together. He even turned out not to be a rapist or a murderer or a pedophile 

So, if you want to built up a good and healthy relationship with your kid, you must have their trust. And to do so, you must trust them. 
This is all well and good, but you're not going to convince me that everything is appropriate for all kids at all ages.
And it isn't. I sure as hell wouldn't recommend showing your 6 year old *Watership Down*. 

But at 14, you have some self awareness. Things that would have a chance of fucking you up aren't easily accessible. And if your little angel is going to be scarred for life because he saw some porn, then you've done something VERY wrong. I say this as a virgin who's had a grand total of one boyfriend: sex shouldn't be seen as something dirty and bad. *that's* how you scar your kid for life. At 14, your kid known what sex is, and he's going to be curious. He'll want to know how it works, and he'll notice his pee-pee does strange things if he thinks about it too much (which he will. Because he - or she - is 14 years old). Telling him it's inappropriate translates to "it's bad". 

Again, if you've raised the kid responsibly to not be an idiot, he's not going to be an idiot. He's not going to arrange a secret romanic overnight trip with "DDLoveXX" on *Real14YearOldGirlsWePromise.com*. He's going to make shitty memes, read about why farts smell bad, and occasionally Google "big boobies". 

Edit: I suck at typing on my phone, so there are probably typos.

This kid is 14 and thinks you're really yelling at him. I think you should apologize, even though you didn't know.
I'm telling you this kid is NOT 14
Why take the chance?
Fried maggots.
Human.
Cow hair.
Penis with rice
Your mother's hairy yeast infected moldy vagina after your little brother splooged in it but only after he fucked your dog. 
Butter or margarine.
Warm Shmegma 
Uhhh does anyone else care that he can't spell the word disgusting ?! 
Typos really grind my gears !!
You know what grinds my gears? The sound of yours grinding.
Baked beans. 
Rice cakes with rice.
Wanted to post here purely because I love OP's username

Heyyo! I'd just like to say that this post is now #5 on top Reddit posts of all time on the entire site.

Glad I got here before it went.. viral.
Just read most of this thread,
Pure gold 
I'm part of Reddit history! :D
All food because rice is fucking gross
Maggots.
Deep fried maggots or live maggots?
Yes.
Both?
Porque no los dos?
It's not fun. Live maggots is more interesting than dead, fried maggots
This rice pasta sure is tasty! But, there's this weird wriggling sensation in my mouth...

Edit: Removed overkill.

OP rates week-old Pizza Hut 9/10 in another comment, so I kinda question his other ratings in this thread.
Pizza Hut dude. I honestly think nothing can be better than that.
Dominos? Unless they've gotten worse since I've moved away, the dominos where I loved was just abnormally good, dominos was always better than pizza hut.

Now, I live in a small town with and INCREDIBLE pizza place. With 0.5 inch thick 1 inch wide pieces of Italian sausage, this crust that is perfectly fluffy and perfectly crisp at the same time... oh it's heaven in your mouth.
You have much to learn, young grasshopper.
>tasty food
Wat?
blah blah blah protein circlejerk
Fucking vegans...
Top post pls ignore
cool_guy123008 waz here
Your life seems boring as f**k
Oh it is.
Ummm...I going out on a limb here, but I eat rice. I've never experienced the thing called "taste" that you speak of. I still enjoy eating rice with ingredients. I thought that was important to mention. Fuck sake.
I'll just leave this here bigup Dustin. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bql0ZmhnHFM&list=UUfarI10hedPeezHyVuWYSWQ
Oh my god this kid has to be one of the richest 14 year olds I know. All for those glorious internet points...
A car
pineapple and rice.
Are you Asian?
I've never seen a single post with over x10 gold. Like, [Jesus Christ](http://img.shockblast.net/2014/03/Luis-Quiles-illustrations-ShockBlast-40.jpg) ^^^^^^NSFW

Anyway, my answer is ice cream.
^ NSFW and sick ^
You like it.
swag

Go ask your mom if you want to know what it tastes like.
Rubbish thread. Op u gay fag 
I Do not believe the OPs age. No way a 14 year old gets his parents to drive him/her to the store to spend hundreds of dollars on food for a reddit post. I dont think OP actually tried any of the suggestions even if the food was in the house. 
This is one of the least funny things I've ever seen on reddit. No lie
Is it in r/funny? 
Would i get upvoted just for saying rice? Lets find out!
apparently not. 
Fruit, cake, burgers, fries, ice cream, and sweets.
Rice pudding and peaches/apricot/mango is the shizzle
Sauerkraut
potato
Dog poo
One spoonful of Coca powder mixed with one and a half spoonfuls of sugar. (If you do this one NOT eat plain coca powder, that stuff tastes horrible by itself.).

Ninja Edit: Apparently I forgot how to spell spoon.

You are a beautiful person... Can you try eating oodon noodles on rice and all sorts of hotdog/hamburger toppings (ketchup, mustard, relish, mayo, onion, pickles and basically the contents of an average middle class family's refrigerator)
